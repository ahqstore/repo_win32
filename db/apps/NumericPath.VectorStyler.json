Cut and merge shapes with the Trim and Join tool. Adjust path endings and node locations along the path using the Extend Path tool. Modify shapes locally with the Offset Path tools. Simplify shapes with the precision node removal feature.\n\nCreate and use dynamically linked symbols and styles. Changes to symbols and styles automatically propagate other the whole document. Use styles to create common attribute definitions for all aspects of objects, including color, outline, content or formatting. Use number variables to define common number attributes.\n\nUse variable and color fonts to create typographic effects. Set text along any path and use bending with variable width profile to stretch text on a path. Setup multicolumn text frames and flow text between multiple linked frames. Use multi-line paragraph composer for precise typography and balance text between columns.\nBuild 1.2.086\n- Fixed a regression with scaling and rotation previews\n- Fixed a bug in undoing contour effect creation\n- Fixed a bug the path smoothing tool\n- Expanding blend on path should position objects correctly\n- Faster font list opening for large lists\n- Changed the default path editor cursor","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.2.086","version":0,"site":null,"source":"NumericPath","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
