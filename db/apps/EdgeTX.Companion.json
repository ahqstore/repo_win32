It is the place where innovative ideas and cutting-edge features are developed and field-tested by the enthusiasts of our hobby. EdgeTX is a community project ‚Äì ideas from the community, developed by the community, and enjoyed by the community! The community will always have a say in what EdgeTX is and what EdgeTX will be in the future. Without community feedback and involvement EdgeTX cannot exist.\nWe are pleased to offer EdgeTX \"Jolly Mon\" v2.11.0. Thank you for all the feedback and testing by you, the community (and partner manufacturers) which has allowed us to identify and squash both new and old bugs!! We simply cannot have done this without you! ü§ó üçª\nNote\n- As with any firmware update, please ensure you back up your model and radio settings before updating, fully bench-test your models after updating, and report any issues you encounter.\n- For MacOS users, Companion is now only compiled for MacOS 13 and above. Stay with v2.10.5 or earlier if you need support for an older version of MacOS.\n- EdgeTX Companion v2.11 can no longer do binary conversions, and thus cannot open .otx files. If you have an old .otx file you need to convert or open, you will need to use an older version of EdgeTX Companion. This follows on from EdgeTX 2.8 being the last firmware version to support binary conversion (i.e. from OpenTX 2.3 or earlier versions of EdgeTX).\nWarning\nDue to a change in how the handset battery voltage calculation is done (due to #5635), you may want to double check the accuracy of your measured handset battery voltage if you have calibrated it in the past. Default value should be pretty close if you have never calibrated it.\nHighlights of this release include:\nNew Handsets\n- Flysky ST16 (with some limitations)\n- Flysky NB4+ (with some limitations)\n- RadioMaster GX12\nGenerally\n- Support for next generation radios (based on H5/H7 micro-controllers) which will bring much faster color LCD and black & white radios, with lots more RAM and flash in order to bring new features and functionality (#5228)\n- Can now use u-blox native binary protocol (rather than only NMEA) if adding a GPS to your handset (#4689)\n- When editing telemetry sensor ratios, you can also see the percentage value to help give the value meaning (#4649)\n- Update to Lua 5.3 (was previously 5.2) - saves some RAM, and also allows for binary compatibility with Companion (meaning .luac files created using simulator on the PC are now compatible with the handset) (#4203)\n- ELRSv4: Master/CRSF trainer option to use ELRS backpack to relay head tracker data as inputs (#5724)\n- ELRSv4: support for optional arming method that frees up CH5 (#5641)\n- For radios with customizable switches, you can now easily create a virtual 6POS group (#5016)\n- Haptic on power on can now be disabled (#5017)\n- Radio can be configured to automatically power off if left inactive (#3414)\n- Sticky logical switch state can be configured to persist across reboots (#4978)\n- USB joystick support for Android game pad functionality (#4626)\n- Even shorter power on/off delay option - 0.5 seconds (#5134)\n- Precision setting for mix delay up & down (in addition to the precision for \"slow up/down\" that was added in 2.10) (#5314)\nColor LCD\n- Radio user interface performance is significantly improved from that of 2.10 (#5031)\n- Top bar widget sizes can be changed (#4846)\n- File browser popup has filters to let you jump through the lists (#4946)\n- Full screen Lua widget \"App mode\", which gives widgets focus to allow for touch and key input (#4655)\n- Lua scripts and widgets can now use LVGL controls (buttons, sliders, input fields) - making it quicker and easier to make a thing that interacts with the user (#4887, #5808)\n- PPM_US can be used instead of percentage values (#4987)\n- Widgets can now have up to 10 options (was previously 5) (#5365)\nB&W\n- Collapsible sections in radio setup tab to make it shorter (#5529)\n- 'Set Screen' special function that lets you switch to a (configured) telemetry screen (#5589)\n- Displays PPM value in channel monitor (in addition to 0.0/0.00 value) (#5781)\n- Added option to invert display color (#4933)\nCompanion\n- Now supports simulation of CRSF/ELRS telemetry (and groundwork done for more to be added), not just FrSky (#5410)\n- Can now use EdgeTX CloudBuild to automatically download translated firmware (#4856)\n- Simulator now uses a generic user interface (rather than semi-realistic), making the interface consistent and easier to add new radio handsets (#5692)\n- Menus have been reorganized to be less cluttered (#5753)\n- Can now Read from and Write to the configured radio SD card profile path (#5753)\nMore information, which is broken down into by screen type (Color LCD and B&W), will be available in the user manual shortly.\nFull Changelog: v2.10.6...v2.11.0\nKnown Limitations and Issues\n- Wireless Model Trainer and CRSF/ELRS - if using the Multi Protocol Module (MPM) as a wireless trainer in conjunction with CRSF/ELRS, do not go above 250 Hz, otherwise the MPM wireless trainer will be dropped. 250 Hz or below is stable.\n- Due to a change in how the battery voltage calculation is done, you may want to double check the accuracy of your measured battery voltage if you have calibrated it in the past. #5635\n- Please check #6106 during the release candidate phase for any other release candidate specific issues and status of fixes.\nUI/UX behavioral changes and/or new capabilities:\n- Color LCD: menus now \"wrap around\" when using the rotary encoder, allowing you to get to back to the top of the list quickly (#4867)\n- Companion: New menus have been added, and menu entries reorganized to be no so cluttered and more logical (#5753)\n- Companion: Now automatically validates if any model settings have any missing mixer or input sources, and prevents writing of invalid model configurations to handset, while turning invalid model names red. Shows a red/green traffic light at the bottom of the models window to indicate overall status (#5798)\nSupported radios\nThe full list of supported radios and their support status can be viewed here on the EdgeTX website.\nInstallation Guide\nhttps://manual.edgetx.org/edgetx-user-manual/installing-and-updating-edgetx\nFlash firmware via Chrome based browser\nhttps://buddy.edgetx.org/#/flash?version=v2.11.0\nLanguage and Custom builds\nCustom prebuilt firmware is no longer available. However, the CloudBuild option in EdgeTX is here to allow you to build your own firmware, with just a few clicks. Additionally, EdgeTX Companion now also has some support for CloudBuild, and will automatically fetch firmware for a supported language when you use the \"Update components\" option. But you can still build your own firmware online following this guide, request a specific build at #6165 or ask on Discord for someone to build one for you.\nNew Contributors\n- @bastian2001 made their first contribution in #4857\n- @493505110 made their first contribution in #5288\n- @LupusTheCanine made their first contribution in #5452\n- @nrw505 made their first contribution in #5410\n- @forbesmyester made their first contribution in #5688","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.11.0","site":"https://edgetx.org/","source":"EdgeTX","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
