Just drag an image into the background, select a frame, zoom and pan to suit, and drag off a finished token. The resulting token is transparent around the edges and cropped to the size you wanted. \nPlatform Notes\nDownload one of the assets listed below. Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.\n- Windows: Use either .msi or .exe.\n  - If you have added custom overlays, they should still be accessible when installing this version over previous versions.\n  - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears. This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.\n- Linux: Use either .deb or .rpm (depending on which packager your system uses).\n  - The deb version installs under /opt/tokentool/bin as TokenTool.\n  - Some Linux distributions have broken native libraries for reading images. If TokenTool crashes with an error regarding how an image may not have a negative width or height, your system has this bug. You can work-around this by deleting the entire Cards directory under Overlays using your system's file manager. (We know the bug exists, but we haven't had a user with this issue offer to help us track it down yet.)\n- macOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.\n  - All downloads are for Intel systems and will execute under Rosetta2 on Apple Silicon systems.\n  - Run the .pkg installer the first time after installation or drag the application from the .dmg image\n  - On first execution, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open.\n  - Then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).\n  - The Gatekeeper may flag the .dmg file as broken. See RPTools/maptool#2679 for more details.\nWhat's Changed\n- Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot by @dependabot-preview in #170\n- Update log4j for security fix by @Phergus in #254\n- Bump commons-io from 2.10.0 to 2.11.0 by @dependabot in #202\n- Bump slf4j-simple from 1.7.31 to 1.7.32 by @dependabot in #204\n- Bump org.beryx.jlink from 2.23.6 to 2.24.4 by @dependabot in #236\n- Bump gson from 2.8.6 to 2.8.9 by @dependabot in #240\n- Bump bcmail-jdk15on from 1.69 to 1.70 by @dependabot in #259\n- Bump com.diffplug.spotless from 5.14.1 to 6.0.4 by @dependabot in #253\n- Bump sentry from 4.1.0 to 5.4.3 by @dependabot in #250\n- Updating dependencies, updating to JDK 17, and some misc recommendations. by @VestOfHolding in #387\n- Merge pull request #33 from RPTools/release-2.1 by @cwisniew in #436\n- fixed a translation error and some minor grammatical errors by @cnschu in #439\n- Merge from main to develop by @rptools-automation in #440\nNew Contributors\n- @VestOfHolding made their first contribution in #387\n- @cnschu made their first contribution in #439\n- @rptools-automation made their first contribution in #440\nFull Changelog: 2.2.1...2.2.2-rc2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.2.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.rptools.net/","source":"RPTools","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
