Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nAdded\n- Support for building the SWIG-generated R language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_R={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.\n- A sandboxing wrapper, dot_sandbox, is now included with Graphviz. Users should prefer their platform’s native security solutions, but if nothing better is available this wrapper offers safe processing of untrusted inputs in some scenarios.\nChanged\n- JPEG images without an APP0 leading segment are supported for use in src fields and friends. Previously Graphviz was overly strict with the types of JPEGs it would recognize. #2619\nFixed\n- The GVPR library program depath no longer acts on previously deleted nodes, causing unpredictable results. #1702\n- Void-typed function parameters (int foo(void bar)) and variables void baz; in GVPR are gracefully rejected. #2585\n- Input that induce a set node height but no set node width no longer crash with the failure “Assertion failed: (r->boundary[i] <= r->boundary[NUMDIMS + i]), function RTreeInsert”. It is typically not obvious to users when their input falls into this situation, hence why the assertion message is quoted here. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2613\n- Strings containing double quote characters preceded by escape sequences (e.g. \\n\") are once again correctly escaped in dot or canonical output. This was a regression in Graphviz 9.0.0. #2614\n- dot_builtins no longer lists duplicate format options in its error messages. #2604\n- A precision error that resulted in truncated edge lines has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2620\n- The xlib plugin (-Tx11) resets its initialization state during finalization. This fixes a rare scenario where multiple input graphs are supplied and initialization for one of the not-first graphs fails. In this scenario, finalization would be unaware of this failure and act on invalid state.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"12.2.1","site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
