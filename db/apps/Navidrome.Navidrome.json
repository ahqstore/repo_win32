This long-requested feature allows you to create separate libraries for different music collections (e.g., personal music, family music, audiobooks) while maintaining proper access controls and data isolation.\nFor full documentation on how to use it, see the new Multi-library page in the documentation website.\n⚠️ Important\nFull Scan\nAlthough this release does not force a full scan on upgrade, you should do it as soon as possible. This is because the multi-library changes affect the move/rename/retag detection and can potentially make you lose annotations (stars, playcounts, playlist references). During the full scan, it will duplicate all your albums, but that's expected. It will remove the duplicates at the end of the scan.\nDatabase Migration Warning\nThis release includes database schema changes that are NOT reversible by simply downgrading to a previous version of Navidrome.\nBefore installing this version:\n1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE - Create a complete backup of your navidrome.db file\n2. TEST ON A COPY FIRST - If possible, test this version on a copy of your data before upgrading your main installation\nIf you need to rollback:\n- Stop Navidrome\n- Restore your database backup\n- Reinstall the previous version\nAdded\nMulti-Library Support\nCreate and manage multiple music libraries with separate music folders.
