The reason is - most likely Android is not rendering UI behind the app when in split screen mode. (UUM-85037)\nChanges\n- XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 4.5.0.\nFixes\n- 2D: Fixed issue where the Active Palette Popup text does not automatically update itself when the selected Palette has been renamed by the user. (UUM-90757)\n- 2D: Fixed issue where the SceneView grid is not restored when the currently selected GameObject with a Grid/Tilemap with its Grid showing is destroyed. (UUM-91461)\n- 2D: Fixed unnecessary scripting call in Sprite Renderer - SpriteRenderer.InvokeSpriteChanged. (UUM-83203)\n- AI: Log a warning in the editor when CalculatePath() starts or ends on multiple NavMesh surfaces. (UUM-84579)\n- Asset Import: Fixed TLS memory leak when importing corrupted FBX file. (UUM-91901)\n- Build System: The BEE_BUILD_THREADS environment variable has been extended to the Bee backend driver. This variable limits the maximum job count for Bee-based builds on your machine, user account, or session, preventing it from consuming all available CPU resources regardless of how builds are run.\".\n- Documentation: Fixed incorrect description of ForceMode.Impulse.\n- Editor: Editor exits Play mode when another project is being created. (UUM-68141)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue in the Linux editor where the top left corner of the display would become noninteractive after an asset database operation occurs after startup. (UUM-92485)\n- Editor: Fixed CPU architecture in the plugin inspector resetting after applying changes. (UUM-91926)\n- Editor: Fixed implicit truncation shader warnings when using the multiplayer VR template. (UUM-84269)\n- Editor: Fixed normal icon used in build window build target list for visionOS. (UUM-68621)\n- Editor: Manually tested with the crashing capture from the bug and several I have locally. Have tested in each test case that the same ProfilerSamples are visited in the same order (by logging them out and diffing the before/after cases). (UUM-79067)\n- Editor: The TreeView and the ListView now have a public member selectedIds which allows users to track the selected ID of items even if they are within a collapsed parent. (UUM-75225)\n- Editor: Unity was not properly detecting the case where a default texture property might be a multisampled texture (it is not technically supported by the syntax, so there is not a direct way to handle it in the shader other than not declaring a default). (UUM-53114)\n- Graphics: Added crash issue with DX11 Tessellation Displacement sample project from the asset store. (UUM-74198)\n- Graphics: Fixed the rendered color of the preset differs from the preview color when adding a new swatch in the HDR Color Picker. (UUM-86724)\n- HDRP: Fixed black line artifacts on top of the screen with DRS and downsampled SSAO. (UUM-69425)\n- HDRP: Fixed HDRP sky rendering when Camera Relative Rendering is disabled. (UUM-90251)\n- IL2CPP: Fixed fields of field types on serialized types being stripped in some cases. (UUM-90024)\n- Kernel: Fixed a potential hang when multiple threads call JobHandle.Complete() on the same JobHandle. (UUM-85405)\n- macOS: Ctrl+C not caught on headless MacOS games, in turn, OnApplicationQuit does not get called. (UUM-87122)\n- Mono: Fixed Editor freeze when taking a Snapshot with a Memory Profiler. (UUM-90945)\n- Mono: Fixed InvalidCastExceptions occasionally being thrown by entity workers after a domain reload. (UUM-87193)\n- Shaders: Fixed a situation where some shaders would appear to cause an internal communcations error with the shader compiler. (UUM-72852)\n- uGUI: Fixed incorrect sorting when viewing nested canvases in prefab mode. (UUM-86544)\n- UI Toolkit: Fixed order of min-max size fields in UI Builder.\n- UI Toolkit: Fixed sprite UV offsets when an opaque border is applied. (UUM-71807)\n- UI Toolkit: Provide a better error message when the generic version of UQuery.Q is called on a null element. (UUM-91728)\n- UI Toolkit: Undoing while editing a label in the viewport will no longer leave the in-place editing text box. (UUM-87944)\n- Universal RP: Fixed an issue where variants were being stripped out in Scriptable Stripping when \"Strip Unused Variants\" was disabled. (UUM-91646)\n- Universal RP: Reduced banding on FSR upscaled render target by changing render target formats. (UUM-52901)\n- VFX Graph: Fixed sprites in Texture Sheet Animation module in HDRP. (UUM-83073)\n- Video: Fixed Recorder VP8/WebM encoded video where i and p frames were incorrectly laid out when viewed on the Chrome browser. (UUM-87258)\n- Video: Resolve issue where VideoClip importer incorrectly caches failed import results on the cache server.
