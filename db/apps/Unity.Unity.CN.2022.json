(UUM-10774)\n- Editor: Fixed an issue where the TextureImporter \"Alpha From Grayscale\" and non-default Swizzle settings would have no effect when used with R16 grayscale source images. (UUM-89039)\n- Editor: Fixed C# script imported leading to missing documentation. (UUM-87334)\n- Editor: Fixed console being cleared after building a player. (UUM-91487)\n- Editor: Fixed Editor errors when \"RGB + 1-bit Alpha Compressed ETC2 4 bits\" compression is used.

(UUM-79322)\n- Graphics: Fixed an issue on Android platforms with Vulkan where swapchain recreation synchronization could cause a degenerate case where pausing the application during a scene load would result in a crash due to an invalid vkCmdEndRenderPass command being added to command buffers that have not begun a render pass. (UUM-90287)\n- HDRP: Fixed HDRP ambient scene lighting leaking into the material preview window. (UUM-84064)\n- HDRP: Fixed invalid global state pushed when using override camera rendering in the CustomPassUtils functions.

(UUM-90028)\n- Scripting: Added InstantiateParameters struct, this adds support for local space and target scenes to Object.InstantiateAsync. (UUM-83002)\n- SpeedTree: Importer Model Editor Inspector: Custom unit conversion no longer allows negative scaling values, will display a warning when negative value is entered. (UUM-82593)\n- Terrain: Changed to use hierarchical transform for tree representation matrix. (UUM-78866)\n- UI Toolkit: Fixed layout issues that sometimes occurred between scene changes.
