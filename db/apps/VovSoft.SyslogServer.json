These can be informational messages, such as user login events, or they can be critical messages, like a failure.\n\nBy using Vovsoft Syslog Server, you can view and archive syslog messages in real-time. Once launched, the application is ready to start monitoring messages coming to your computer. These messages play an important part in a network administrator's arsenal of tools; they alert the admin of errors and warnings right as they happen, allowing them to quickly respond to problems and hopefully fix them before they become major issues.\n\nSyslog messages are also important to have for security audits. For each device that you wish to have send its event logs to your syslog server, you need to ensure that its remote syslog service is enabled and that it is pointed at the IP address of your computer. Syslog uses UDP port 514 by default; each sending device and the receiving syslog collector need to be able to access this port.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.4.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
