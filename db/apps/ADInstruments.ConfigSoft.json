Using ConfigSoft allows 100% control of the telemeters and SmartPad and/or tBases and therefore reduces handling of the animals and associated stress, it is all done through the software. The software also collects and outputs telemeter, SmartPad and tBase diagnostic information and manages their settings. The channel numbers of the Kaha Sciences Telemetry system tell the components (telemeters, SmartPads and Configurator) which frequencies to communicate on.\nConfigSoft also allows you to select from up to 40 independent transmission or receiving channels, this ensures these no crossovers, data loss, or interference between different telemeters and receivers.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.02.0000","version":0,"site":null,"source":"KahaTelemetry","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
