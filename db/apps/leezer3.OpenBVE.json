In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.\nCompared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.\nSignificant Changes:\n- New: Add basic support for MSTS / OpenRails trains.\n- New: Add se-SE translation (Daniel Nylander)\n- New: Add FogDistance parameter to dynamic backgrounds.\n- Fix: A very large viewing distance could cause visual artifacts with the background.\n- Fix: An invalid path could crash the TFO parser.\n- Fix: Handle a couple of cases with missing required textures in the panel.cfg parser.\n- Fix: Functions containing a CarIndex failed to handle reversal of the train correctly.\n- Fix: Switch change dialog missing.\n- Change: Attempt to cancel loading when a fatal error is caught, rather than directly unloading the renderer. (Timing issue on some systems)\n- Change: Assorted new features / improvements to particle source generation.\nNew Errata:\nhttps://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Errata#fog-distance","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.12.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://openbve-project.net/","source":"The OpenBVE Project","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
