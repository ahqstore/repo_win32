In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.\nCompared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.\nSignificant Changes:\n- New: Perform inline face squashing whilst loading in the MSTS Shape parser. This vastly increases the render speed of complex MSTS models.\n- New: Implement basic analog for MSTS material shaders. This should fix missing parts on many of these models.\n- Fix: Some MSTS bogie matricies were not recognised. (These are likely on OpenRails standard models)\n- Change: Improve train loading progress display. (KennyHui)\n- Change: TrainEditor2 will now write XML format trains. This is a work in progress, and not all properties are currently implemented.\n- Fix: Incorrect loaded EndSound for primary horn.\n- Fix: Correctly handle the case where a decimal is used when an integer is expected in new CFG block parser.\n- Fix: Assimp OBJ parser failing to handle faces with no normals.\n- Fix: Timetables could be missed by the bracket detection code in CSV route parser.\n- Fix: New CFG parser no longer accepts negative length cars.\n- Fix: GL.InvalidValue could be generated in debug mode.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.11.1.5","site":"https://openbve-project.net/","source":"The OpenBVE Project","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
