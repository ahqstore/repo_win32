In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.\nCompared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.\nThe last release of 2025....\nSignificant Changes:\n- Change: Improve the display of the JumpToPosition value in Route Viewer.\n- Fix: GL Menu not working in 1.11.3.2\n- Fix: Old renderer not working correctly in 1.11.3.2\n- Fix: Issue when uncoupling some trains.\n- Fix: Particle sources were updating whilst in a menu.\n- Fix: Incorrect particle flow direction when reversing.\n- Fix: Constant speed device not working after a backwards jump.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.11.3.3","version":0,"site":"https://openbve-project.net/","source":"The OpenBVE Project","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
