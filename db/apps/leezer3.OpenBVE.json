In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.\nCompared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.\nSignificant Changes:\n- New: Add $ElseIf command for CSV routes.\n- New: Add MotorBrakeNotch property for XML trains.\n- MSTS: Handle Pantograph1 animations with suffix.\n- MSTS: Implement some variants on the line voltage display.\n- MSTS: Fix some content with the brakes stuck on.\n- MSTS: Better handling for some comments and non-standard number formating.\n- Compability: Update routefile hacks database.\n- Fix: Preserve the compatible transparent mode when extracting a texture clip region. (Fixes handle images on some BVE2 panels)\n- Fix: Couple of issues in CarXMLConverter since converting to block format","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.12.1.0","version":0,"site":"https://openbve-project.net/","source":"The OpenBVE Project","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
