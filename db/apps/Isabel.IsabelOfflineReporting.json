Due to this local information storage, quick searches can be made and detailed reports can be generated. To facilitate the change to Isabel 6 and to guarantee the excellent performance and continuity of your reports, Isabel makes an offline reporting program available.\nIsabel Offline Reporting stands for a state-of-the-art reporting program with the same functionalities (and more) than reporting in IBS5.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1.0.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.isabel.eu/","source":"Isabel NV/SA","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
