The breaking change in this is that starting with this release, the GPU Temperature Sensor is non-functioning.\nIt has been left present for backward compatibility reasons, however it will always return 0.\nPlease see the awesome writeup by @DarkAutumn for more details #43 (comment)\nPlease see Docs for how you can get GPU temperature information using the standalone version of Libre Hardware Monitor.\nSome changes, some fixes and hopefully not a lot of bugs :)\nChanges\n- Added support for Fan domain for Quick Actions (thanks to @axa88 for suggestion) #369\n- Added configuration backup that is done before migration from LAB02 version actually happens #377\n- Added WinFormsSleep command (version of sleep command using specifically WinForms API) (thanks to @felipecrs for suggestion) #378\n- Added ability to test MQTT connection during onboarding process (thanks to @jgstew for suggestion) #379\n- Added missing \"use WebSocket\" option to MQTT onboarding step #379\n- Added \"MonitorSleepPowerPlan\" command to turn off screen by temporairly modyfying the power plan (should not cause the device to go to sleep) #380\n- Added permission checks for both client (issues with administrative permissions) and service (not running as system) #383\n- Added suport for \"HumanPresence\" internal device sensor #281\n- Added new \"NamedActiveWindow\" binary sensor that can tell you if window containing specified name is currently active or not (thanks to @YpsilonTM for suggestion) #298\n- Added new \"AccentColor\" sensor that provides #RRGGBB values for Windows' accent colors (thanks to @kineticscreen for suggestion) #299\n- Added WebSocket support for MQTT connections (experimental :)) (thanks to @axelcypher for suggestion) #253\n- Added x86 (32bit) support to the project and the published artifacts (thanks to @DoplerGanger for suggestion) #322\n- Added ability to \"hold\" the KeyCommand for longer time by making it a switch type (thanks to @f-hicks for suggestion and testing) #325\n- Added support for selecting on which screen WebView will appear (thanks to @denisabt for the PR!) #246\n- Added support for button helpers (input_button) for quick actions (thanks to @drewsteinacher for the PR!) #199\nFixes:\n- Fixed rare issue where LocalAPI would not work due to device configuration missing #358\n- Fixed Home Assistant MQTT warning log regarding \"object_id\" deprecation (thanks to @Anto79-ops and @Momentum6890 for reporting) #372\n- Fixed device discovery messages not being properly removed when device name is changed #376\n- Fixed order of sensors and commands so they are sorted alphabetically by the first letter #381\n- Fixed onboarding donation message so it's clear all donations go towards original creator of HASS.Agent - Sam #384\n- Fixed MQTT entities changing ID after device rename #388\n- Fixed/changed Satellite Service installation logic so it limits possibility of upgrade failing silently (even though there was no UI error) and/or leaving the Libre Hardware Monitor files (.dll and .sys) which causes Windows Defender to still report them even though they are not actively used. #352\n- Fixed HASS.Agent crash when no WebView screen was explicitly configured (thanks to @cronner for reporting) #346\n- Fixed issue where user would be presented with \"You're running the newest version\" even though internet was unavailable (thanks to @patienttruth for reporting) #247\n- Fixed relative URIs in the notifications not opening properly when clicked on (thanks to @felipecrs for reporting) #294\n- Fixed typo in the onboarding screen (thanks to @epipenRX for reporting) #300\n- Fixed quick actions window not scaling properly with the system scale (thanks to @MathisP75 for reporting) #301\n- Fixed repeating audio sensors error log when no default input or output is present because it was removed (thanks to @floriangagnard for reporting) #302\n- Fixed (once and for all?) issues with hotkey and german keyboard layouts by changing the default one to Shift+Control+Q (thanks to @FatalMerlin for reporting and to @f-rakete for help in fixing) #303\n- Fixed issue where InnoSetup installer parameters would not be passed on to the Satellite Service installer (thanks to @KrX3D for reporting) #306\n- Fixed satellite service missing AudioManager initisation, causing AudioSensor not to work properly (thanks to @Dvvarf for reporting) #326\n- Fixed HASS.Agent refusing to start after bluetooth dongle was removed with RadioCommand configured (thanks to @barrelltitor for reporting) #333\n- Fixed note regarding Home Assistant long lived token generation and minor wording tweak (thanks to @SVNKoch for the PR!) #156\n- Fixed the tray icon being blurry when using RDP extensively (thanks to @whc2001 for the PR!) #249\n- Fixed code typo in printer sensor's code (thanks to @Selim042 for the PR!) #318\n- Fixed issue where error of one internal device sensor would cause issues with configuration of others #338\n- Fixed update notification being shown at startup even though general update notifications were disabled (thanks to @stavismed for reporting) #239\nOther:\n- Updated readme file (part 1) #385\n- Removed dependency on LibreHardwareMonitor that uses WinRing0 (thanks to all people that reported this, especially for @DarkAutumn for all the research!) #280\n- Moved project from .net6 to .net8 (thanks to @ricoroodenburg for suggestion) #284\n- Updated dependencies #304\n- Github Action artifact version update and build target version bump #225\nDevice renaming\nFor best results with renaming devices, this version should work with newest integration version: https://github.com/hass-agent/HASS.Agent-Integration/releases/tag/2.1.2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.2.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/hass-agent","source":"HASS.Agent Team","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
