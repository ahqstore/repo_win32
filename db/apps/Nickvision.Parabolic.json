This is due to me starting a new full-time job and thus leaving only the weekends for me to work on these projects. This does not mean I am stopping development, it just means that releases, updates, and fixes will unfortunately take longer now. I appreciate all of your support and patience for these updates. Any C++ developers who would like to work on the projects with me as well are more than welcome too and are encouraged to reach out to me on Matrix!\nFull Changelog ðŸ“ƒ\n- Added the display of the file size of a format if it is available\n- Fixed an issue where file paths were not truncated correctly\n- Redesigned the Qt app for a more modern desktop experience\n- Updated yt-dlp to fix some website validation issues","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2025.5.0","site":"https://github.com/NickvisionApps","source":"Nickvision","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
