The captured screen can then be sent to the printer, or saved to disk as a file in 6 different graphics file formats.\n\nWant to create a screenshot suitable for saving or printing? Then just hit a key on your keyboard. Oh yeah, you'll have to download this program first.\nThere are several hotkey combos to choose from (PrintScreen is the default). Once you've chosen your favorite combo, head to the Destination tab and have the screen print out instantly, copy the capture to the clipboard, save it to a specific folder, or even send it through e-mail. You can perform full screen captures, or only capture a specific window.\nThere are also six different image formats to choose from, and each one can be resized. With all the customization capabilities, what more could you ask for?\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.5.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.gadwin.com/","source":"Gadwin, Ltd.","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
