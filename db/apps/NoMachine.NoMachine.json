The nxhtd and libexpat libraries, now based on httpd 2.4.66 and expat v2.7.3, incorporate fixes for CVE-2025-65082 and CVE-2025-59375, respectively. Whilst NoMachine may not be directly impacted by these vulnerabilities, keeping library versions up to date is essential for overall security and compatibility. This release additionally implements improvements to NoMachine's load-balancing custom algorithm by allowing NoMachine virtual desktops to be load-balanced among the nodes of an Enterprise Terminal Server according to the RAM usage on the nodes.\nThese are the trouble reports solved by this 9.3.7 release:\nTR12W11654 - After a quick disconnection and reconnection, sometimes the sessions cannot be resumed\nTR11W11633 - Cannot enter filename when copying a file to Ubuntu 24 in web sessions started from Chrome\nTR11W11622 - Disabling all profile rules in some cases overrides all the other rules set\nTR11W11634 - NoMachine LAN hosts are not showing or are slow to appear on player v.9.2\nTR10W11617 - Unexpected exit of server daemon process after adding a license\nTR11W11619 - Some applications don't work correctly in KDE Plasma when NoMachine 9.2 is installed\nTR11W11627 - Connection notification should not be clickable when the server status is not accessible\nTR12W11644 - Load-balancing of Linux virtual desktops may not work properly when 'Load average' or 'system load' algorithms are used\nTR10W11586 - Black screen connecting to Rocky Linux 9 server\nTR11W11618 - NoMachine RPM packages cannot be verified on recent RPM-based systems\nTR12W11658 - NoMachine server is not handling password change requests properly with Red Hat SSSD","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.3.7","version":0,"site":"https://www.nomachine.com/","source":"NoMachine S.a.r.l.","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
