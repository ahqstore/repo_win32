Voice applications are programs that interact with the user via the phone and then perform certain logic. For example, you can create a voice application that asks for a caller to input a customer number, which is then verified against a database. Based on this number the call can then be routed to a certain queue. Because the 3CX Call Flow Designer is entirely visual, little telephony or programming knowledge is required.\n\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"20.2.84","version":0,"site":"https://www.3cx.com/","source":"3CX Ltd","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
