When the big buffer is filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.\n\nReading/Writing are processed with no OS cache, so other applications do not become slow.\nIt can achieve Reading/Writing performance that is close to the device limit.\nInclude/Exclude Filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified. ver3.0 or later, Relative Path can be specified.\nIt runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only)\nAdded \"Move uses Move(No overwrite)\" option in the Shell Extension settings. (Pro only)\nImproved write speed to FAT-based file systems(FAT16/FAT32/exFAT) when running with administrator privileges.\nWith the \"Move(No overwrite)\" mode, if a file already exists in the DestDir, it is now treated as Error instead of Skip.\nOther refinements.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.10.0","version":0,"site":"https://fastcopy.jp/","source":"H.Shirouzu & FastCopy Lab, LLC.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
