From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.\nThe unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.\nAll other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.\nOur extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.\nYou can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.\nThe current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.\nPV*SOL premium is available in German 🇩🇪, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, French 🇫🇷, Italian 🇮🇹, Polish 🇵🇱, Czech 🇨🇿, Portuguese 🇵🇹 and Turkish 🇹🇷. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.\nOur technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.\nThe following new features and changes are included:\n- In the circuit diagram, circuit symbols can now also be inserted in front of AC battery systems and electric vehicles (only if the vehicle does not have its own from-grid tariff).\n- In the consumption dialog, the load profiles from measured values are now displayed in groups.\n- When exporting plans, the type of plan is now appended to the file name.\nThe following bugs have been fixed:\n- When configuring multiple module areas, no more module areas could be assigned from the second inverter onwards.\n- Crash when loading projects from program version 2025 with solar peak law that were not simulated.\n- Partial crashes on the welcome page when the program was closed.\n- Crash when loading projects with battery systems or electric vehicles if there was more than one group and results were already available.\n- Problems with the load profile ID if there was only one from-grid tariff left in the tariff list.\n- Partial crashes in the dialog for selecting load profiles.\n- Correction of the display of the discharge power of electric vehicles (factor 1000).\n- A payback period of “1 year and 12 months” is now displayed as “2 years”.\n- Crash in short presentation when there were multiple battery system groups with the same battery system product.\n- Crash when the field for the name of an “Additional heat source -> Other heat source” was left blank in thermal systems.\n- In off-grid projects, the battery system was not displayed correctly in the circuit diagram.\n- Crash on the project report page when there were errors (e.g., a bitmap that was too large) in the circuit diagram.\n- Error when calculating savings if electric vehicles were used to cover consumption.\n- Crash in “New Project” when multiple battery system groups were used but the first group was not selected.\n- Problems displaying the design bar for very high power ratings and consumption.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2026.2","version":0,"site":"https://valentin-software.com/en/","source":"Valentin Software GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
