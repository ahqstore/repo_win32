It aims to provide a consistent and secure authentication experience,\nincluding multi-factor auth, to every major source control hosting service and platform.\n\nGCM supports (in alphabetical order) Azure DevOps, Azure DevOps Server (formerly Team Foundation\nServer), Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. Compare to Git's built-in credential helpers (Windows:\nwincred, macOS: osxkeychain, Linux: gnome-keyring/libsecret), which provide single-factor\nauthentication support for username/password only.\n\nGCM replaces both the .NET Framework-based Git Credential Manager for Windows and the Java-based\nGit Credential Manager for Mac and Linux.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.6.1","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/git-ecosystem","source":"GitHub","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
