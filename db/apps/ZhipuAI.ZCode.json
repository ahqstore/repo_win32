By providing a unified and user-friendly visual desktop interface, it seamlessly integrates the capabilities of these Agents, allowing smooth switching and experience across multiple Agent programming tools with just one API key. Additionally, it offers a series of features including secure file version management, efficient code review, task agents, MCP protocol management, and more, delivering you an all-in-one AI-assisted development experience.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.12.2","version":0,"site":"https://z.ai/","source":"Z.AI","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
