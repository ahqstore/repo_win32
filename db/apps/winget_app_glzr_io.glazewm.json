Cloaking causes all windows to be shown in the taskbar, which is now configurable with general.show_all_in_taskbar.\n- Improve --centered flag behavior for set-floating and toggle-floating (#842).\n- Revert alt+s and alt+a in the default config to switch focus between prev/next active workspace (#865).\nüêõ Bug fixes\n- Restore to previous tiling size from minimized/fullscreen (#876, fixes #506 #782).\n- move-workspace moves cursor if cursor_jump is enabled (#874, fixes #859).\n- Fix focus_follows_cursor on touchpads (#875, fixes #799).\n- Prevent moving tiling windows with mouse from affecting hidden workspaces (#877, fixes #829).\n- Fix path delimiters to CLI directory in PATH env variable (#872).\n\nBig thanks to @DreamMaoMao and @michidk for contributing to this release üíõ/ @lars-berger","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.7.0","site":"https://github.com/glzr-io","source":"Glzr Software Pte.
