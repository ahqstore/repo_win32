This software allows for the DC40 driver to be completely controlled through the GUI or in tandem with manual adjustment using the physical inputs on the device. While using the GUI Software, the set current and current limit can be precisely saved for later applications. The GUI Software also enables the use of LEDs without Thorlabs' EEPROM technology.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.0.411.89","site":"https://www.thorlabs.com/","source":"Thorlabs GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
