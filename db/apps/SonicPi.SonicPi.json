This new release introduces a significant overhaul of the GUI shortcuts. You can now choose between the default (called Emacs Live), Windows or Mac modes. There's also a wonderful new function for working with tuplets designed by Dago Sondervan. We've also added some beautiful new samples created by Sheffield techno legends The Black Dog. These came from the experimental sister live-coding platform \"Bleep\" developed by Sam Aaron and Guy Brown at the University of Sheffield (https://bleep.sheffield.ac.uk).\nAll dependencies have been updated and there are many, many bug fixes and internal improvements from a wide range of contributors - thank-you!\nGUI\n- Complete overhaul of the shortcut system.\nImprovements\n- Where supported, you can now independently specify different input and output sound cards in the audio-settings.toml config file. This is done with the new options input_sound_card_name = \"\" and output_sound_card_name = \"\". Note, you still have to ensure that the sample rate is the same for input and output.\n- Incoming OSC bundles are now supported. Timestamps are ignored (if OSC scheduling is a commonly requested feature this could be added in the future). This increases compatibility with software which exclusively sends OSC in bundle format such as TouchDesigner.\nNew Fns\n- tuplets - Run a block with tuplet timing and optional swing. Lets you supply a nested list such as [70, 72, [73, 74], 76] and a block. It will run the block passing in each element of the list and the sleep time between block calls will be automatically calculated depending on the length of the tuplet. Non-nested values e.g. 70, 72 and 76 will take one beat each and nested values 73, and 74 will change the time density depending on the length of the nested list. So, a nested [73, 74] will be with density 2 (all time values are halved) and a nested [73, 74, 75] will be with a density of 3 which creates triplets. There are also options to add swing and set the duration of one tuplet beat (defaults to 1).\nSamples\n- New CC0-licensed samples by Sheffield techno legends The Black Dog: :tbd_fxbed_loop, :tbd_highkey_c4, :tbd_pad_1, :tbd_pad_2, :tbd_pad_3, :tbd_pad_4, :tbd_perc_blip, :tbd_perc_hat, :tbd_perc_tap_1, :tbd_perc_tap_2, :tbd_voctone\n- Two new ride cymbals :ride_tri and ride_via.\n- New hi-hat :hat_len.\nTranslations\n- Improvements to the French, German, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian and Turkish translations.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.6.0","version":0,"site":"https://sonic-pi.net/","source":"Sonic Pi","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
