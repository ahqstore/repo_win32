You can quickly test the RAM speed of your desktop or laptop computer.\n\nWhether you want to get information about the health of your RAM or check their specifications match, a benchmarking tool can do the trick. This software povides a means of assessing the performance of memories by running a benchmark test to find RAM speed. In an attempt to keep things as simple as possible, the program features a minimalistic interface that only allows you to start the test with the click of a button. If you will try to overclock your memory, you can easily use this program and get quick test results. On most motherboards, you can simply enable built-in \"overclocking\" profiles, which will show up as an \"XMP\" (Extreme Memory Profile) or \"DOCP\" (DRAM Overclocking Profile). After increasing or decreasing MHz value, you can measure the effect of this change on memory performance by using this test tool.\n\nThis application is a free memory benchmark tool and it supports DDR5, DDR4, DDR3, DDR2, DDR1 and SDRAM types. It usually doesn't take long before the result of the benchmark test is shown on the screen. The speed is revealed in MB/s.\n\nBenchmark programs usually measure theoretical top speeds of devices. On the contrary Vovsoft RAM Benchmark measures the real-world speeds by allowing the user to change \"Block Size\" parameter. This program can write and read a huge memory block. If the memory has an issue, the performance will be degraded, as it is in real life.\n\nAdditionally, the software can check memory bandwidth. It tests system memory bandwidth using a process similar to the large memory-to-memory buffer copies in multimedia processing. This feature can only work when run as administrator.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.6.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
