If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).\n  https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-84616\n- Terrain: Trees do not render in 'Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene' (UUM-84616)\n- Vulkan: [Android] Particles not rendered in the Player on some Android devices with Android 14 (UUM-68080)\n6000.0.29f1 Release Notes\nImprovements\n- Editor: Added array slice and mipmap info to the render graph debugger.\n- Editor: Added extra validation to the render graph texture descriptor to avoid silently failing when a user tried to create an invalid texture.\n- Editor: Improved material creation for PBR Sky custom material.

(UUM-86779)\n- Editor: Fixed bug where toggling the Incremental GC or active input handling player settings and then restarting the editor didn't result in the new setting taking effect. (UUM-85422)\n- Editor: Fixed build profile bugs when toggling the virtual texturing setting:\n  1. Updating the player setting value didn't get serialized to the asset file.\n  2. Toggling the virtual texture player setting for an inactive profile still showed the restart editor prompt.\n  3. Even after restarting the editor, we didn't update EditorOnlyVirtualTextureState.json that the PlayerSetting methods used as the source of truth for the setting, which resulted in a subsequent restart prompt appearing as the project was opening after the initial restart.
