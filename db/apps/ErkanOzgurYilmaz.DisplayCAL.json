At its core it relies on ArgyllCMS, an advanced open source color management system, to take measurements, create calibrations and profiles, and for a variety of other advanced color related tasks.\nCalibrate and characterize your display devices using one of many supported measurement instruments, with support for multi-display setups and a variety of available options for advanced users, such as verification and reporting functionality to evaluate ICC profiles and display devices, creating video 3D LUTs, as well as optional CIECAM02 gamut mapping to take into account varying viewing conditions. Other features include:\n- Support of colorimeter corrections for different display device types to increase the absolute accuracy of colorimeters. Corrections can be imported from vendor software or created from measurements if a spectrometer is available.\n- Check display device uniformity via measurements.\n- Test chart editor: Create charts with any amount and composition of color patches, easy copy & paste from CGATS, CSV files (only tab-delimited) and spreadsheet applications, for profile verification and evaluation.\n- Create synthetic ICC profiles with custom primaries, white- and blackpoint as well as tone response for use as working spaces or source profiles in device linking (3D LUT) transforms.\n\nThis project intended to modernize the DisplayCAL code including Python 3 support.\nFlorian Höch, the original developer, did an incredible job of creating and maintaining DisplayCAL for all these years. But, it seems that, during the pandemic, very understandably, he lost his passion to the project. Now, it is time for us, the DisplayCAL community, to contribute back to this great tool.\nThis project is based on the HEAD of the Sourceforge version, which had 5 extra commits that Florian has created over the 3.8.9.3 release on 14 Jan 2020.\nThanks to all the efforts put by the community DisplayCAL is now working with Python 3.9+.\nWarning\nIn MacOS, after installing DisplayCAL you need to run the following in Terminal:\nxattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DisplayCAL.app\nRelease Notes\n- [ALL] Added support for ArgyllCMS 3.4.0+ in regards of the update on the observer names of CIE 2012 2° and CIE 2012 10° being CIE 2015 2° and CIE 2015 10°. Depending on the ArgyllCMS version the old names are still going to be accessible through the UI.\n- [ALL] Fixed an issue related to the black point correction being applied even if it is disabled introduced in DisplayCAL 3.9.15.\n- [ALL] Fixed dispread arguments not being added to argument list by @Anulap\n- [ALL] Fixed unnecessary argument quoting in DisplayCAL.wexpect.spawn_windows.__init__() by @eoyilmaz\n- [ALL] Fixed IndexError in a string formatting in DisplayCAL.worker by @vastunghia\n- [Windows] Fixed the issues related with displays with scaling value more than 150%, where DisplayCAL errors out on startup by @eoyilmaz\n- [Windows] Fixed Profile Loader \"Identify Monitor\" and \"Exceptions\" dialog crash by @Anulap\n- [Windows] Fexed output level reporting for and some other issues related to madVR by @eoyilmaz\nWhat's Changed\n- 556 update osx install instructions by @eoyilmaz in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/558\n- 553 anybutton error by @eoyilmaz in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/559\n- Windows specific fixes for various feature by @Anulap in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/579\n- 580 a bytes like object is required not int when trying to verify with colormunki by @eoyilmaz in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/582\n- Fix issue #577 by @vastunghia in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/589\n- 585 displaycal can not start after first install by @eoyilmaz in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/598\n- [#583] Added support for the new names given for the CIE 2012 2° and … by @eoyilmaz in https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/pull/599\n- [#570] Fix for #570.
