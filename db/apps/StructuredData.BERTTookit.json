Specifically, it’s designed to support running R functions from Excel spreadsheet cells. In Excel terms, it’s for writing User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in R.\nAll you have to do is write the function. Everything else – loading the function into Excel, managing parameters, and handling type conversion – is done automatically for you. It really could not be any easier.\nBERT also has a console that you can use to control Excel in real time, right from your R code. And (if you want), you can call R functions from VBA as well.\n- Please install as a regular user, not Administrator\n- Installer includes both 32 and 64 bit builds\n- Getting started with BERT\nChanges:\nFixes poor call performance in 2.4.3.\n\nVersion 2 represents a complete rewrite and rearchitecting of BERT. See this page for more on new features and tips on upgrading from older versions.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.4.4","site":"https://bert-toolkit.com/","source":"Structured Data LLC","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
