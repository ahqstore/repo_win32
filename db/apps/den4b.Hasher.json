Multiple hash types can be generated simultaneously per file. Handy hash and file comparison functions, such as holding SHIFT to compare to next file or CTRL to compare two files, will make this task a breeze.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.den4b.com/","source":"den4b Team","license_or_tos":"CC-BY-NC-ND-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
