However, if this isn’t what you want, you can set the filament’s dependency to restrict it to a specific printer. For custom filament settings created with 2.3, it will automatically set to be compatible with the current printer model only. In the following video, I demonstrate how to change my “Aliz PETG @Voron” filament, which is optimized for my Voron machine and won’t work with my other printers. I set its dependency to make it visible only to my Voron machine.\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf51f39d-c471-4848-bf24-797abbbb8cdf\nWhat's Changed\n- Backup User Profiles:When OrcaSlicer upgrades to a new version by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8953\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc86849-cf20-4f30-a9d4-a8b671516ebf\n- Allow generating brims for objects inside other object's hole by @Noisyfox in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8914\n- Fix a bug that, in some instances, caused sending large print jobs to the Bambu machine to be slow by @3vi1 in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8925\n- Fix crash when resetting filament presets by @Noisyfox in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8911\n- Use .gcode.3mf as ext for gcode 3mf files by @SoftFever in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8928\n- Fix wrong first layer temperature when ooze prevention and print-by-obj are enabled by @Noisyfox in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8927\n- Fix crash when support bottom interface layer is set to same as top by @Noisyfox in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8955\n- Set Crosshatch as default infill pattern instead of grid by @bistory in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8952\n- fix de after update locale by @hliebscher in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8803\n- Fix Creality Hi extruder_clearance_height_to_lid by @bistory in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8806\n- Improve the pt-BR translation of \"plate\" by @afmenez in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8828\n- Add pause gcode command to Sovol SV08 & SV07 by @cochcoder in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8840\n- Show Creality CR-6 Optimal processes by @cochcoder in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8848\n- Update TURKISH translations (2.3.0-rc) by @GlauTechCo in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8851\n- Adding more pt-BR translations by @afmenez in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8871\n- Fix typo by @wrathernaut in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8872\n- Change Elegoo Centauri Start GCode to Wait for bed temp by @thelegendtubaguy in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8882\n- Traditional Chinese Localization Update in 2.3.0-rc by @shuwn in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8883\n- Added TPU, ABS, and PETG Profiles for Co Print ChromaSet-2 by @coprint in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8888\n- Update Catalan language for OrcaSlicer V2.3.0 Release Candidate by @davidjuanesb in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8913\n- bugfix and updates in profiles for MK3.5 by @koppensb in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8778\n- Add Lulzbot Taz 4, 5, Pro Dual, Pro S by @wrathernaut in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8844\n- Fixes/Improvements for Creality profiles by @cochcoder in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8850\n- Output x64 registers to windows crash report too by @Noisyfox in https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8951","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.3.0","site":"https://orcaslicer.com/","source":"SoftFever","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
