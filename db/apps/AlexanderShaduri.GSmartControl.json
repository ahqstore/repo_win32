It allows you to inspect the drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well as run various tests on it.\n- Support GCC 11 (and Ubuntu 22.04) by using and vendoring fmt library (#77).\n- Support an option of saving smartctl output to text instead of JSON (#76).\n- Restored pre-2.0.0 runtime support for smartctl < 7.3 (based on Text parser); this is an unsupported, old method without NVMe, provided for compatibility only (#77).\n- Restored pre-2.0.0 support for standard (non-extended) self-test log found in very old ATA drives; the new JSON parser did not support this previously (#79).\n- Better support for temperature values in JSON parser; this fixes unreasonably large temperature values (#78).\n- Add a tooltip explaining self-test \"lifetime hours\" wrapping behavior (#73).\n- Windows: Fixed a crash on Windows 7 when opening drive information by using Windows 7-compatible librsvg (#71).\n- Windows: Avoid using non-integer font sizes.\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ashaduri/gsmartcontrol/commits/v2.0.2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.0.2","site":"https://shaduri.dev/","source":"Alexander Shaduri","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
