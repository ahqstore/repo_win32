So we created this tool to provide a free, easy to use GUI application for working with MSAs.\n\nFeatures\n- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (no LDAP or powershell knowledge required)\n- Quick and easy to create and assign new MSAs, as well as removing old MSAs\n- Create and configure Group Managed Service Accounts introduced in Windows Server 2012\n- Install and uninstall MSAs on remote computers\n- Configure properties of existing MSAs, including the ability to disable them, set their expiry date, add them to groups, modify SPNs, and more\n- Uses native Windows APIs and LDAP operations where possible instead of Powershell for improved performance\n- Multi-domain friendly, simply enter the domain name (and credentials) for any domain you want to manage MSAs on\nFixed a bug that caused installation of a standalone MSA to fail with the error \"all pipe instances are busy\" in some scenarios\nGUI improvements and fixes\nImproved diagnostic logging","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.6.0","version":0,"site":"https://cjwdev.com/","source":"Cjwdev","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
