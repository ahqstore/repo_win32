QueueExplorer is a fast, native Windows application. \n\nWith QueueExplorer you can dig into your queues and see which message went where, whether they were correctly formatted, with correct headers and settings, etc.\n\nMultiple viewers are at your disposal: JSON, XML, WCF, Hex, text with different encodings.\n\nFully functional 14-days trial.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.0.58","version":0,"site":"https://www.cogin.com/","source":"Cogin","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
