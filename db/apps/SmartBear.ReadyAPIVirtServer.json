It is an addition to ReadyAPI Virtualization that is used for creating, editing, and running virtualized services.\nVirtServer is tightly integrated with ReadyAPI Virtualization, allowing you to run and manage virtual services created with ReadyAPI Virtualization and hosted on VirtServer. VirtServer runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and headless machines .\n- Support for ReadyAPI version 3.62.0: Updated VirtServer to support ReadyAPI version 3.62.0.\n- File-Based Licensing Support Removed: As outlined in our File-based License End-of-Support Policy, support for Protection LS and file-based license types has been removed from ReadyAPI. The licensing code has been refactored. Only SLM licenses are now supported.\n- Accessibility Improvements: Introduced several accessibility improvements as part of an ongoing effort to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n- Bug Fix: Resolved an issue in SwaggerHub where mocks created from API definitions with nested references did not return the correct response. Mocks now return the expected response with the specified body in the API.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.29.0","version":0,"site":"https://smartbear.com/","source":"SmartBear Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
