It contains among other things an optimizing C compiler, a macro assembler, a linker, a resource compiler, a message compiler, a code signing utility, a make utility and an install builder. \n\nIt also contains an integrated development environment (IDE) with project management, debugger, profiler, source code editor, and resource editors for dialogs, menus, string tables, accelerator tables, bitmaps, icons, cursors, animated cursors, animation videos (AVI's without sound), versions and manifests.\n\nThe compiler was originally based on LCC (by Chris Fraser and David Hanson), but since then enhanced with support for C99/C11/C17/C23, a global optimizer, a new register allocator, a function inliner, intrinsic functions, and many Microsoft C extensions.\n\nFeatures:\n- Support for 32-bit Windows (X86) and 64-bit Windows (X64).\n- Support for the newer C standards C99, C11, C17, and C23.\n- Support for OpenMP version 3.1.\n- Support for most SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES, AVX, AVX2, and AVX512(F) intrinsics (X64 only).\n- Integrated source code editor with call tips and symbol browsing.\n- Integrated source-level debugger.\n- Integrated sampling profiler.\n- Project management.\n- Inline assembler for X86 (not X64, since intrinsics are better).\n- Integrated resource editor.\n- Integrated bitmap, icon and cursor editor.\n- Integrated animated cursor and video editor.\n- Integrated hex-dump editor.\n- Support for custom controls in the dialog editor.\n- Support for custom project wizards.\n- Pelles C is freeware. See terms of use.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"13.00","version":0,"site":"http://www.smorgasbordet.com/","source":"Pelle Orinius","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
