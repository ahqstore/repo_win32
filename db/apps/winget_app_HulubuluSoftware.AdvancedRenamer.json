By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.\nIt is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.\nWith Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.\nBefore performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.\nMediaType tag\n\nUse the tag <MediaType> do get the media type group name. Advanced Renamer groups files into 5 categories. Use this tag to extract this value. The media type is determined by the file extension and is not based on the actual content. Possible valures are: image, audio, video, document, and other\n\n\"Now\" option added to Timestamp method\n\nUse the \"Now\" option in the Timestamp method to quickly set the timestamp to the current date and time. This is faster than setting the same value with the absolute date and time option.\n\nRead metadata from font files\n\nFor the first time, Advanced Renamer gets support for reading metadata from font files. The supported file types are .ttf and .otf.\n\nRecognize any date and time metadata value\n\nIf the name of a meta data value contain the words tdate or time, it can be parsed and used as a regular timestamp value, by adding a second parameter for the format, like yyyy-mm-dd_hh_nn_ss. You can even adjust the timestamp value with the adjustment parameter added in version 4.04.\n\nFull list of changes in version 4.06\n- New tag on the default tab: <MediaType> which will return the media type of the file. The media type is determined by the file extension and is not based on the actual content of the file. The media type is one of the following: image, audio, video, document, or other\n- New \"Change to\" option for Timestamp method: Now\n- Added support for reading metadata from the font file formats .ttf and .otf\n- Any metadata value with a key containing \"time\" or \"date\" and has a value in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\" will be treated as a date and time value and can be formatted and adjusted as such\n- When setting relative date and time, the input boxes did not allow negative values\n- Before starting a batch containing errors, a warning will be shown, if \"Stop batch\" is clicked, the main window would become unresponsive\n- Blue color when name collision rule detected changed to a brighter blue when dark theme is used\n- The convenience tags <Img DateOriginal>, <Img DateCreate>, <Img TimeOriginal>, and <Img TimeCreate> no longer use ExifTool to retrieve the value\n- Clear list now also clears Item Details panel\n- Added support for some MakerNote metadata values from Nikon cameras\n- Improved support when metadata structures are embedded in other metadata structures\n- Made the method list respond faster when expanding methods in a long list\n- Support animated PNGs","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.06","site":"https://www.advancedrenamer.com/","source":"Hulubulu Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
