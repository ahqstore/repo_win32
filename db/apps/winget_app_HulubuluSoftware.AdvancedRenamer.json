By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.\nIt is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.\nWith Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.\nBefore performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.\nNew column showing list index\n\nA new column has been added to the list showing the index of the item in the list. When using the List method to rename files the value of the index column will correspond to the line numbers in the text field.\n\nSet file timestamps to metadata value\n\nThe Timestamp method can be used to set new file level timestamps, like created date and modified date. Now these values can also be set to the value of any timestamp metadata value embedded within any media file.\n\nFile details moved to new location\n\nIn the item details window, file level information has been moved to the same tables as other metadata values. Choose the item File in the group dropdown.\n\nSee details of CSV Data import\n\nIn Advanced Renamer file items can be enriched with values from a CSV file to be used with the <CSV:X> tag. To show the values imported for a file, select the newly added CSV in the group dropdown in the item details panel. It will show up after CSV values are imported. Select a value and click Copy tag and insert it into the renaming method of choice to use the value in the renaming batch.\n\nFull list of changes in version 4.08\n- New column: Index showing the item index in the list\n- Fixed an issue where the new names wasn't automatically tested when moving items, toggling the checkbox, or sorting columns\n- Customize columns window: When removing a column the next column couldn't be removed before the listbox was selected again\n- Modified date and time is now displayed correctly when loaded in a different daylight savings time offset than current time on macOS\n- Made Timestamp batch method available for macOS\n- New option for Timestamp method: Metadata field.
