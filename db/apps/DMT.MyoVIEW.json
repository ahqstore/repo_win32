Using accurate edge detection from up to four user-defined zones, MyoVIEW averages the lumen measurements much simpler and more reliable.\nWall structure, wall stress, strain, and myogenic tone are measured, and responses to increases in pressure, flow, and drugs are evaluated regarding vascular diameter changes.\nMyoVIEW provides data acquisition, calculations, and export of data for analysis purposes. It even allows you to create advanced calculations to customize your live traces, add a script and traces such as strain is live instantly.\nEasy and quick use, allowing full control of many parameters and management of data. Display the screen view as you want – there is complete flexibility to arrange windows neatly and save your preferred layout.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.5.7.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.dmt.dk/","source":"Danish Myo Technology","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
