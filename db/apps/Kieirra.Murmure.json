The new logging system avoids exposing transcriptions by default, and automated security scanning (SonarQube) has been introduced to further strengthen code integrity.\nFinally, both the macOS and Windows versions are now officially signed. Windows may still display reputation warnings initially, as the certificate builds trust over time.\n✨ New Features\n- (Major) Select Command — Select any text and transform it using a custom command (fix grammar, translate to English, rephrase, etc.). Murmure now works as a contextual AI editor, not just a speech‑to‑text tool.\n- (Major) LLM Prompts — Multiple saved prompts with:\n  - Syntax highlighting in the prompt editor\n  - Anchor tags enforcement for safer output control\n  - New “Cursor Developer” preset\n- Input Microphone Selection — Choose your preferred input microphone directly in Settings. Thanks to @litel-fr.\n- Dictionary Import / Export — Import and export custom words, including medical presets. Thanks to @icristescu (#72]).\n- Text Insertion Mode — Choose how text is inserted:\n  - Standard mode\n  - Terminal-compatible mode\n  - Direct typing mode\n    (#119])\n- Log Verbosity Controls — Configure log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error) and quickly open the logs folder from the app.\n• macOS: Improved global shortcut handling — no longer limited by system-reserved shortcuts (Thanks to @HachetAmaury)\n🐛 Bug Fixes\n- Fixed fullscreen issue on Select Model page on macOS (#82]).\n- Transcriptions are no longer logged by default for improved privacy (#88]).\n- Temporary audio files are now saved in the system tmp folder instead of app_dir in case of crash ([#88](#88)).\n- Fixed invalid word format error message in dictionary.\n- Allow digit conversion threshold to be set to 0.\n- Updated dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities.\n♻️ Refactor\n- Resolved major SonarQube issues.\n- Streamlined shortcut logic and optimized event lookup for better maintainability and performance.\n🔧 CI & Security\n- Added Security Scanning with SonarQube.\n- Improved static analysis for contributions (tests, compilation, linting, etc.).\n- Windows NSIS (.exe) installer now runs without requiring administrator privileges.\n📜 License Update\nMurmure is now released under the GNU AGPL v3 instead of the GPL v3.\nThis change strengthens the project’s commitment to open-source principles by ensuring that any network‑accessible modifications must also remain open source.\nMurmure 1.7.0 strengthens its position as a privacy-first, local AI companion, combining speech recognition, contextual editing, and LLM workflows — all running on your machine.\n🙌 Thanks to all contributors and testers who continue to make Murmure better with every release. @HachetAmaury @laurentkempe @thiswillbeyourgithub @stevebeauge @vclerc @icristescu @litel-fr","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.7.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Kieirra","source":"al1x-ai","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
