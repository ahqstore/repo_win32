Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.\nWith Blender, you can create 3D visualizations such as still images, 3D animations and VFX shots. You can also edit videos. It is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.\nBeing a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems. It also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.3.2","site":"https://www.blender.org/","source":"Blender Foundation","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
