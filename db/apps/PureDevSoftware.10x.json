The parser is fast and robust and incrementally parses as you type. It provides syntax highlighting, goto-definition, autocomplete and a lot more.\nThere are many editors/IDEs that promise everything, but it often comes at a cost, either in terms of responsiveness, robustness, or complexity of setup. With 10x, there is no need to compromise. You get the features you need with a fast and responsive editing experience.\n10x is aimed predominantly at the professional developer working on large and complex C++ codebases where productivity is vital. 10x makes it easy to quickly navigate around a large project and find what you need. 10x keeps you in the flow.\nCoding at 60fps with instant workspace search is something you just have to experience. You may not think your current editor is slow until you try 10x.\n10x supports opening of Visual Studio projects, opening folders, and the creation of custom 10x workspaces.\n10x is currently Windows only. Support for other platforms is planned for the future.\nAs well as a custom built C++ parser, 10x also has syntax highlighting for many other languages.\n10x also has a powerful python API, which allows functionality to be added using python scripts.\nSummary\n\nFixed occasional freeze at the end of a full parse (introduced in previous build)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.366.0","site":"https://www.puredevsoftware.com/","source":"PureDev Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
