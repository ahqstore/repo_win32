Thanks Crow for reporting.\n- Feature: Allow toggling performance-related canvas view settings, since some systems get slowdowns. Thanks DevonJP for reporting.\n- Fix: Don't force TLS socket algorithms, since ECDSA certs seem to not like them. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.\n- Fix: Log message queue read, write and timeout errors properly. Thanks Pepper for reporting.\n- Feature: Implement WebSocket support in the server, available with the --websocket-port and --websocket-listen options.\n- Feature: Send keepalive messages from the server, if the client indicates support for it. Avoids them disconnecting when too busy uploading to send a ping.\n- Feature: Active user counts for sessions. A user counts as active if they drew in the last five minutes.\n- Feature: Make invite links indicated web client capability and NSFM-ness of sessions so that the invite page can show a \"join in the browser\" button and an appropriate notice respectively. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting the latter.\n- Fix: Properly handle cancelling a connection while it's being established. Thanks Fox for reporting.\n- Server Fix: When hosting without an account is enabled, also allow it for anyone with an account. Thanks ahaven for finding this.\n- Fix: Don't resize brush settings unnecessarily larger when switching between brush types. Thanks Meiren for reporting.\n- Fix: Try to handle switching between tablet pen and eraser more consistently. Thanks Daystream for reporting.\n- Feature: Add next and previous key frame actions, allowing skipping between key frames in the current track. Thanks BulletPepper for reporting.\n- Fix: Properly refer to \"layer\" and \"layer group\" in layer actions depending on what is selected. Thanks Momo for reporting.\n- Fix: Save censored layers into PSDs properly. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.\n- Fix: Don't allow copying, cutting and color picking from censored layers.\n- Fix: Rotate brush and fill outline along with the canvas. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting and xxxx for helping solve some issues with it.\n- Feature: Add experimental support for high-DPI interface scaling.\n- Fix: Don't reset opacity multiply inputs to default when loading a brush that doesn't have it set. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.\n- Fix: Limit MyPaint brush dab counts to more sensible values, since the defaults from MyPaint are pointlessly high and can cause chugging. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.\n- Fix: Don't blink last user cursors again when making a selection.\n- Fix: Make user cursors trail MyPaint brush strokes better, only smoothing it out when there's jitter. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.\n- Feature: Show latency in the status message, next to the session size and cursor coordinates. Thanks Meiren for suggesting.\n- Feature: Add action to pick color from screen, default shortcut is Shift+I. Thanks Meru for suggesting.\n- Feature: Allow switching the current brush to erase mode when using the tablet pen eraser instead of switching to the eraser tool slot. The setting for this is in the Input settings.\n- Feature: Make the Windows installer put a shortcut on the desktop.\n- Fix: Widen the stripes of the censor pattern so that it's easier on the eyes. Thanks Ben for reporting.\n- Fix: Don't remember uncensor layers across restarts, to avoid being exposed to things you didn't want to just because you forgot to toggle it back off.\n- Fix: Properly show censored layers in the list even when they are revealed.\n- Server Fix: Allow reading users' trusted status through the API, because it's something you can write through it.\n- Server Feature: Allow limiting the maximum number of users per session. Moderators and administrators can override this.\n- Server Fix: Time out clients that take too long to disconnect gracefully. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.\n- Fix: Properly apply layer properties if the layer changed since opening them.\n- Feature: Show last joined address in join dialog.\n- Fix: Hide disconnection banner after establishing connection to a session.\n- Fix: Make censoring layer groups actually have an effect.\n- Fix: Don't use 64 bit stuff in 32 bit Windows installer.\n- Fix: Don't break pinned start menue shortcuts when updating on Windows. Thanks Bluestrings and anonymous for reporting.\n- Server Fix: Don't report temporary server bans as permanent. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.\n- Server Fix: Properly convert between IPv4 and IPv6 when checking IP bans. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.\n- Fix: Use proper measurements to decide on how much painting to do in a single step, hopefully preventing chugging caused by certain brushes.\n- Server Fix: Save catchup keys to file-backed sessions so that the counter doesn't reset upon a server restart.\n- Fix: Don't show user cursors while catchup dialog is open.\n- Feature: Add some bulk permission commands for (un)trusting and setting layer tiers, explanation available through /modhelp. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.\n- Fix: Don't gray out layer ACL tier settings when a layer is assigned to users exclusively, since those settings are not exclusive.\n- Fix: Don't include stuff from before session reset when restarting a recording because of one. Thanks Meiren for reporting.\n- Fix: Don't overwrite recordings on Windows if the file names contain non-ASCII symbols. Thanks Meiren for reporting.\n- Fix: Make log file on Windows log non-ASCII symbols properly.\n- Fix: Don't reorder listing servers when sorting by title in the browse tab.\n- Feature: Remember last sorting on the browse page. Thanks Bluestrings and Meiren for suggesting.\n- Fix: Only ask for confirmation when a self-signed TLS certificate changes, not when a \"real\" one renews. Thanks Bluestrings and Pepper for reporting.\n- Feature: Fill background for copying the merged image with a non-rectangular selection. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.\n- Fix: Make bezier curve tool generate smooth curves at small sizes, rather than getting jaggy. Thanks Crow for reporting.\n- Server Feature: Allow server owners to kick users not connected to a session.\n- Fix: Make navigator slider not eat keyboard inputs when navigator is undocked. Thanks anonymousduck for reporting.\n- Fix: Disregard hidden frames when rendering animations. Thanks Etide for reporting.\n- Server Feature: Log when a wrong password is entered for server accounts and sessions, disconnect the user after too many wrong tries.\n- Server Fix: Log client host and join attempts even when unsuccessful. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.\n- Fix: Load default settings values after the program has initialized, avoiding crashes that can happen on Windows when building in debug mode.
