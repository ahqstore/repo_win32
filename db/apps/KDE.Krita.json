It is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone.\n\nKrita is a FREE and open source painting tool designed for concept artists, illustrators, matte and texture artists, and the VFX industry. Krita has been in development for over 10 years and has had an explosion in growth recently. It offers many common and innovative features to help the amateur and professional alike.\nToday we are releasing Krita 5.2.13! This is a bugfix release containing a number of important Android fixes, courtesy of Carsten Hartenfels, our new Android Maintainer. The release also includes a security fix that affected the work with TGA files.\n16K Page Size support\nSome devices running Android 15 have so much working memory that Android 15 increased the page size (the smallest unit the working memory is divided up in). To work with on these devices, programs like Krita need some adjustments, or else they won't even run! With Krita 5.2.13 you won't have to worry about this distinction anymore, as 16K page size support has been added.\nSaving fixes\nOne of the most frequent crashes on Android was caused by background saving going wrong. We've overhauled the saving service, fixing crashes when Krita was being shut down or when it is inactive in the background.\nNow, operating systems like Android make file system handling a little tricky because they would like to keep each file inside a so-called sandbox, so your program cannot do anything without your explicit permission. This is generally a good thing, but it is very different from how desktop operating systems work, and we're still working on figuring out how to make Krita work more pleasantly while staying inside the sandbox, so look out for that in the future!\nTransform fixes\nPreviously, the transform tool would not work with touch, because it relied on mouse-press, instead of mouse-click, which is what touch events are. We've worked around this, and now you should be able to manipulate the transform widget with your fingers.\nAutomatically disable touch-painting on devices with stylus present\nNow, when Krita detects a stylus present in proximity of the tablet device it automatically disables touch painting for the rest of the session. It lets new users start painting with their stylus right away without visiting Krita's Preferences dialog. If you still want to be able to paint with your fingers and with your stylus at the same time, you can explicitly enable touch-painting in Configure Krita->General->Tools->Touch Painting->Enabled.\nFix for a security issue when loading TGA files\nThere was a theoretical security issue when loading TGA files, which could cause buffer overflow in Krita. This issue is now fixed in Krita 5.2.13. If you have not yet updated to 5.2.13 we highly recommend you to avoid opening TGA files from unknown sources.\nOther\nBeyond that, there are two crash fixes.\n- Index Colors: fix crash when filtering non-transparent layer\n- Fix crash in palette docker with add swatch dialog.
