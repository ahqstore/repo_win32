It is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone.\n\nKrita is a FREE and open source painting tool designed for concept artists, illustrators, matte and texture artists, and the VFX industry. Krita has been in development for over 10 years and has had an explosion in growth recently. It offers many common and innovative features to help the amateur and professional alike.\nToday we're releasing Krita 5.2.16. The previous version of 5.2 had issues with saving heif, heic and avif files, and while we are busy preparing 5.3, we decided this was worth it to make another release over.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.2.16.0","version":0,"site":"https://kde.org/","source":"Krita Foundation","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
