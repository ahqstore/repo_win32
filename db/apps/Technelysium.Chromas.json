Chromas has the following features:\n- Opens .ab1 chromatogram files from Applied Biosystems DNA sequencers.\n- Opens SCF and ZTR format chromatogram files created by other sequencers or retrieved from databases.\n- Save in .scf or Applied Biosystems .ab1 format.\n- Print a chromatogram with options to zoom or fit to one page.\n- Automatic removal of low-quality sequence (when quality data is available) or vector sequences.\n- Export sequences in plain text, FASTA, FASTQ, EMBL, GenBank or GCG formats, or formatted with base numbering for presentation.\n- Copy the sequence to the clipboard in plain text, FASTA or FASTQ format for pasting into other applications.\n- Reverse & complement the sequence and chromatogram.\n- Search for subsequences by exact matching or optimal alignment.\n- Display translations in 3 frames along with the sequence.\n- Copy an image of a chromatogram section for pasting into documents or presentations.\n- Batch processing, including format conversion, sequence export with vector removal, batch printing and batch export of raw data.\n- Enhance .ab1 files using the PeakTrace RP component from Nucleics Pty Ltd to improve peak readability and extract more high-quality bases.\n- BLAST searches can now be sent directly to the server to bypass web browser URL length limits. Results still open in the browser.\n- Fixed BLAST searching for sequences containing hyphen characters.\n- Added a raw trace data display toggle under the Options menu.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.6.6","version":0,"site":"https://technelysium.com.au/","source":"Technelysium Pty Ltd","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
