This release adds Indonesian language support to the Plus UI, a new template for the WeType Input Method Editor (IME), and support for proxy configuration using host names instead of raw IPs by resolving them at WSA_Startup. Sandboxie can now bind to network adapters rather than specific IP addresses, providing more flexibility in networking setups. Additionally, support for the %ProgramFiles(x86)% environment variable has been introduced, along with a new TemplateDefaultFolders entry to define standard paths in privacy-enhanced boxes.\nSeveral changes improve usability and performance. The \"Move Sandbox\" list sorting behavior has been refined, and personal details like name and hardware ID in the Support tab are now hidden by default. An experimental alternative proxy relay implementation has also been added, shifting from socket modification to relay threads.\nNumerous issues have been addressed. These include the BoxAlias not appearing in the \"run in box\" dialog, UI inconsistencies after using Ctrl+F, and persistent high I/O usage by SbieCtrl.exe and SandMan.exe. Registry access functions were hardened with additional checks, and problems with Tencent TIM, MSI installer behavior, and oversized Sandboxie.ini files have been resolved. Other fixes address UI glitches, translation inconsistencies, drag-and-drop issues, and crashes related to SbieDll.dll. Compatibility problems with PingInfoView and a loop condition in CollectProducts() have also been fixed.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nKnown Issue\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.15.12","site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"http://xanasoft.com/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
