A new checkbox for the “NoRestartOnPCA=y” setting has been added to the box options, giving users direct control without manual editing. The default value for “UseWin32kHooks” has been reverted from “y” back to “n” after it was found to cause compatibility issues with certain applications. Additionally, named syscall invocation under WoW64 has been improved to ensure more robust operation in mixed-architecture scenarios.\nA significant focus of this update is stability, with several critical fixes in both user-mode and driver-level components. The “OpenWndStation=y” option now works correctly again when used together with “SandboxieAllGroup=y”.\nMost importantly, this update includes fixes that directly affect the driver’s stability. A flaw that could lead to incorrect driver responses during certificate parsing and driver-info queries has been resolved, and a potential handle leak in SbieDll.dll involving SbieApi_DeviceHandle has been fixed as documented in issue #5097. These corrections eliminate scenarios that, under certain conditions, could have contributed to resource exhaustion or triggered system instability, reducing the risk of potential BSODs and improving overall reliability of the sandboxie.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.16.7","version":0,"site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"http://xanasoft.com/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
