This version introduces a new protection option that blocks non-administrative instances of the session leader, such as Sandman.exe or Sbiectrl.exe, from accessing encrypted box data. This safeguard is enabled by default, though it can be disabled by setting ProtectAdminOnly=n if required. In addition to this enhancement, the release resolves a critical issue where Sandboxie-Plus 1.16.3 failed to connect to the driver on Windows Preview Build 27943, as tracked in issue #5003. Stability has also been improved with a fix for crashes related to the latest Signal client. Furthermore, the internal checks in Thread_CheckObject_CommonEx have been strengthened to provide more robust handling of encrypted boxes. This update continues the projectâ€™s focus on reliability, compatibility with evolving Windows builds, and stronger data protection.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.16.4","version":0,"site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"http://xanasoft.com/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
