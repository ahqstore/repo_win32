A issue affecting Windows 7 users introduced in 1.16.5 has been resolved, ensuring that the program can once again establish a proper connection to the driver on this platform. Compatibility with recent Firefox Nightly builds (version 146) has also been addressed, allowing the browser to run correctly within the sandbox environment. This version also introduces a change to the default configuration: the UseWin32kHooks=y option is now enabled by default for all sandboxed processes. This adjustment significantly improves compatibility with Electron-based applications, reducing issues that some users previously experienced.\nOverall, Sandboxie-Plus 1.16.6 / 5.71.6 continues the effort to refine system compatibility, stability, and performance across both legacy and modern Windows systems.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.16.6","version":0,"site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"http://xanasoft.com/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
