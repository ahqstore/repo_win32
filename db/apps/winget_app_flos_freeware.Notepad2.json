When I was looking\naround for text editors with syntax highlighting, I have come across the Scintilla source code\nediting component. I was very much impressed by this project, so I decided to create my own\nScintilla-based text editor.\n\nThe result is Notepad2, a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting.\nThis program can be run out of the box without installation, and does not touch your system's registry.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.2.25","site":null,"source":"Florian Balmer","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
