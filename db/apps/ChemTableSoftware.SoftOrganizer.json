Soft Organizer now\n  accurately identifies traces and calculates the disk space occupied by Steam\n  and games installed through it.\n- Added dependency detection for related applications. If a user attempts to uninstall\n  Steam without first removing games installed via the platform, a warning will be\n  displayed. This ensures games do not become inoperable, as they may depend on Steam’s\n  framework (uninstallation must follow a reverse order: games first, then Steam).\n- Fixed duplicate applications in the list that occurred in some сases. For\n  example, when AOMEI Partition Assistant was installed, a redundant entry named\n  AOMEI Partition Assistant_is1, which served no purpose, would be added to the\n  list.\n- Fixed Bug: When uninstalling COMODO Internet Security Pro, the standard\n  uninstaller did not work.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"10.10","site":"https://www.chemtable.com/about_us.htm","source":"ChemTable Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
