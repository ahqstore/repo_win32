All included.\n- Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.\n- All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.\n- All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.\n- To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.\nThis week's release includes support for installing agents through the new ACP Registry, Agent message queuing as the default behavior (with the ability to edit and interrupt queued messages), per-tool permissions when confirming agent tool use, MCP server support for remote development, Vim-style tag stack navigation for \"Go to Definition\" jumps, EditorConfig inheritance from parent directories, and improved Dev Container support including Podman.\nFeatures\nAI\n- Agent: Added the ability to install new Agents via the ACP Registry. (#47470)\n- Agent: Added the ability to edit queued messages. (#47234)\n- Agent: Added a menu item in the agent panel right-click menu for copying a given agent's response. (#46529; thanks DepsCian)\n- Agent: Added @diagnostics to \"New Thread\" conversations so you can feed current language-server diagnostics directly into the Agent Panel context. This keeps parity with text threads while staying within the cursor-aware assistant workflow. (#42270; thanks GoldStrikeArch)\n- Agent: Made it easier to interrupt the agent while having messages in the queue. (#46954)\n- Agent: Made queuing prompts the default behavior when sending them while there's an on-going generation. (#46797)\n- Agent: Added reasoning content support for the OpenAI provider. (#43662; thanks aeroxy)\n- Agent: Changed the display of tokens for OpenAI models to reflect the input/output limits. (#46829)\n- Agent: Changed the behavior of queued messages to gracefully wait for the current activity to complete. (#46980)\n- Agent: Improved streaming tool call performance by batching UI updates. (#46802)\n- Agent: Added support for running MCP servers on the remote server when using remote development. This can be enabled by setting the \"remote\": true property in the settings entry for the MCP server. (#46756)\n- Agent: Added the ability to set per-tool permissions when confirming/denying tool use. (#46284)\nLanguages\n- Markdown: Improved bracket colorization. (#47026)\n- Python/Ty: Added support for using venv-installed ty binary. (#47029)\nVim / Helix\n- Added Vim-style tag stack navigation. \"Go to Definition\" jumps are now tracked in a dedicated stack, so you can navigate back through them without wading through your full navigation history. Use the new pane: go to older tag and pane: go to newer tag commands. (#46002; thanks zenazn)\nRemote Development\n- Changed opening bundled files, keymap, local release notes and the log file view to open in remote windows instead of opening a new local Zed window. (#46910)\n- Changed opening the settings files, keymap files, task files and debug files to open within WSL windows instead of opening a new local Zed window. (#46910)\nOther\n- Improved Dev Container support (#47021; thanks KyleBarton):\n  - Added modal to initialize a dev container definition in the project with projects: initialize dev container.\n  - Added Podman support for dev container actions with the use_podman setting.\n  - Improved devcontainer error handling.\n- Workspace: Added the list of recent projects to the multi-project title bar menu. (#46828)\n- Added the language server's path to a tooltip that is shown when hovering on its status in the language server menu. (#47037)\n- Added support for .editorconfig files outside the project directory. Zed now traverses parent directories to find and apply EditorConfig settings. Use root = true in any .editorconfig to stop inheriting settings from parent directories. (#46332)\n- Settings UI: Added support for viewing and updating project settings files in remote projects. (#45292)\n- Improved pane::CloseActiveItem to close center pane items even when focus is on a dock panel like the project panel or outline panel. (#46421; thanks FloppyDisco)\nBug Fixes\n- ACP: Fixed env vars not being properly applied to built-in ACP agents. (#46946)\n- Agent: Fixed a bug with the message queue in the agent panel where @-mentions weren't being displayed in the message preview within the queue entries list. (#46964)\n- Agent: Fixed terminal command truncation in the agent panel to better expose long commands (e.g., potentially dangerous multi-line commands are now fully visible before execution). (#40570; thanks miguelcsx)\n- Agent: Fixed Anthropic models not appearing in the Copilot Chat model picker. (#47591)\n- Debugger: Fixed a crash that occurred when splitting a pane by dragging a pane item that originated from that pane. (#46806; thanks xcb3d)\n- Terminal: Fixed vi mode cursor not visually updating when navigating with vi motion keys. (#46762; thanks xcb3d)\n- Fixed \"Add Folder to Project\" and \"Remove from Project\" menu items being incorrectly hidden on remote projects. (#47283)\n- Fixed editor::AddSelectionAbove and editor::AddSelectionBelow when skipping over soft-wrapped lines to preserve the original cursor column when adding selections through lines shorter than the starting position. (#46911)\n- Fixed a bug with very wide tables not being fully visible in markdown previews. (#46834)\n- Fixed agent model selector cutting off models at the end of the list. (#47263)\n- Fixed an issue where a few file descriptors would be leaked each time a project was closed. (#47246)\n- Fixed an issue where rebuilding a dev extension would compile the extension in release and not debug mode. (#47165)\n- Fixed context menus dismissing/canceling when the window loses focus. (#46866; thanks notnotjake)\n- Fixed incorrect rendering of characters at large font sizes on macOS. (#45957; thanks JonyLab)\n- Fixed issue where markdown tables rendered within lists would overlap items above/below it. (#46783)\n- Fixed json-language-server not considering file_types from project settings. (#46991)\n- Fixed onboarding page saving the selected theme based on the system appearance and not the currently selected one. (#47245; thanks HackAttack)\n- Fixed poetry environment not discovered on Linux. (#47100; thanks lingyaochu)\n- Fixed project search include/exclude filters not working correctly in remote project with multiple folders. (#47280)\n- Fixed remote connections getting stuck in limbo when the server side dies unexpectedly. (#47200)\n- Fixed screen sharing performance on Windows and Linux. (#46986)\n- Fixed terminal cyan color displaying as green in One Light theme. (#45691; thanks MateoKruk)\n- Fixed trackpad scrolling being too fast in terminal applications with mouse mode enabled (tmux, Neovim, opencode, etc.). (#45600; thanks emamulandalib)\n- Fixed \"Format Selection\" not working when editing files over SSH remote connections. (#47194)\n- Fixed AI commit message button in Git panel being hidden instead of disabled when no AI provider is configured. The button now remains visible with a tooltip explaining how to enable the feature. (#46525; thanks ivan-magda)\n- Fixed language injections sticking after language comment removed. (#47790)\n- Fixed mistyping the SSH password in the askpass prompt on Windows locking you out of retyping the correct one. (#47760)\n- Fixed excessive disk space usage from the hang_traces directory. (#47693)\n- Fixed a bug where terminal tasks failed to start on Windows when using cmd.exe.
