All included.\n- Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.\n- All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.\n- All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.\n- To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.\n- Fixed Agent Server extensions having the current working directory of the extension rather than the project (#42777)\n- Fixed an issue where the git panel checkbox was flickering and getting out of sync with file state on disk (#42661)\n- Trying to open invalid URLs in a browser now shows an error instead of panicking (#42637)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.212.6","version":0,"site":"https://zed.dev/","source":"Zed Industries","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
