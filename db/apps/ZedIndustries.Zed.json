All included.\n- Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.\n- All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.\n- All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.\n- To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.\nThis week's release includes the ability to open the Agent Panel with an initial prompt via URL, sending terminal selections into Agent threads, automatic blocking of dangerous Agent commands like rm -rf /, Azure as a Git provider, GitLab merge request links in git blame hover popover, and right-click downloading of files and folders from remote development servers.\nFeatures\nAI\n- Edit Prediction: Added support for multiple edit prediction providers, including GitHub Copilot's Next Edit Suggestions, Ollama, Codestral, Sweep, and Mercury Coder. To configure, open the Edit Prediction menu and select Configure Providers.\n- Agent: Added support for opening the Agent Panel with an initial prompt via zed://agent?prompt=<url_encoded_text> URL.
