All included.\n- Zed now speaks WSL. You can open a Linux distro as a first-class “remote” target, edit projects that live inside it.\n- All of Zed’s AI features, including edit predictions and ACP-powered agents, are fully supported on Windows.\n- All Zed extensions now work seamlessly on Windows; no special steps, no caveats.\n- To run on almost all Windows versions, including VMs, we created a new rendering backend based on DirectX 11.\n- Fixed a panic when following ACP agents across buffers.
