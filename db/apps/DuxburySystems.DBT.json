Or, visit the Duxbury Website for both new information and historical information about DBT features and updates.\nSupport for SWIFT\n- DBT runs a web service that allows connectivity to a web-based implementation of SWIFT.\n- All template (.dxt) files have been to revised to correct a minor error in the names of linear styles. This will be needed to work with web-hosted editions of SWIFT.\nBANA Braille Template\n- DBT 14.1 includes BANA Braille 2024, an updated version of the BANA Braille template created by Susan Christensen.\nLanguage Support\n- Sotho (Northern and Southern Pedi) print-to-braille translation has been modified to update contractions per input from a South African authority, as has Tswana translation.\n- Mi'kmaq (Mi'kmaw) translation support has been added in this release.\n- The Swahili (Kenya) translators (both print-to-braille and braille-to-print) have been updated to correct the handling of a certain shortform.\n- The English/Unified (UEB) print-to-braille translation table has been has been updated to correct a problem whereby a required grade 1 indicator could be missing in certain instances where a hyphen immediately follows an expression explicitly declared to be \"technical\", e.g. when a \"math\" style is applied to just the \"x\" in \"x-coordinate\". This change also affects translation of several uncontracted languages where print-to-braille translation is derived from the UEB table and UEB learning series (\"Weebee Dots\") translation. Contracted forms of several unusual words have also been corrected in print-to-braille translation.\nEmbosser Support\n- A top margin adjustment automatically applied to ViewPlus Columbia embossers is now also applied to Irie BrailleTrac embossers.\nPython: PDF and Macros\n- DBT includes support for importing PDF files and a general-purpose macro facility. These two major new features require support of Python, an optional installation component that may be omitted when required by network policy.\nInstaller\n- Operation of the DBT installer in French is corrected.\nMathematics\n- Importation of mathematics markup from the Equation Editor built into Microsoft Word 2007 and newer is considerably improved.\nMiscellaneous\n- DBT/Win display of error messages from failed imports is improved.\n- DBT 14.1 corrects a longstanding defect that would cause unusual instances of extra characters being inserted as the start of the first word of each page when importing .brf or .prf files.\n- Over eighty new user interface languages are new to DBT 14.1.\nWe are constantly working on improved language support.
