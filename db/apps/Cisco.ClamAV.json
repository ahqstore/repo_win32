Sigtool now has commands\n  to sign and verify using the external signatures.\n  ClamAV now installs a 'certs' directory in the app config directory\n  (e.g., <prefix>/etc/certs). The install path is configurable.\n  The CMake option to configure the CVD certs directory is\n  -D CVD_CERTS_DIRECTORY=PATH\n  New options to set an alternative CVD certs directory:\n  - The command-line option for Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool is\n    --cvdcertsdir PATH\n  - The environment variable for Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool is\n    CVD_CERTS_DIR\n  - The config option for Freshclam and ClamD is\n    CVDCertsDirectory PATH\n  Added two new APIs to the public clamav.h header:\n  cl_error_t cl_cvdverify_ex(\n      const char *file,\n      const char *certs_directory,\n      uint32_t dboptions);\n  cl_error_t cl_cvdunpack_ex(\n      const char *file,\n      const char *dir,\n      const char *certs_directory,\n      uint32_t dboptions);\n  The original cl_cvdverify and cl_cvdunpack are deprecated.\n  Added a cl_engine_field enum option CL_ENGINE_CVDCERTSDIR.\n  You may set this option with cl_engine_set_str and get it with\n  cl_engine_get_str, to override the compiled in default CVD certs directory.\n  Thank you to Mark Carey at SAP for inspiring work on this feature with an\n  initial proof of concept for external-signature FIPS compliant CVD signing.\n  GitHub pull request #1\n  GitHub pull request #2\n  GitHub pull request #3\n  GitHub pull request #4\n- Freshclam, ClamD, ClamScan, and Sigtool: Added an option to enable FIPS-like\n  limits disabling MD5 and SHA1 from being used for verifying digital signatures\n  or for being used to trust a file when checking for false positives (FPs).\n  For freshclam.conf and clamd.conf set this config option:\n  FIPSCryptoHashLimits yes\n  For clamscan and sigtool use this command-line option:\n  --fips-limits\n  For libclamav: Enable FIPS-limits for a ClamAV engine like this:\n  cl_engine_set_num(engine, CL_ENGINE_FIPS_LIMITS, 1);\n  ClamAV will also attempt to detect if FIPS-mode is enabled. If so, it will\n  automatically enable the FIPS-limits feature.\n  This change mitigates safety concerns over the use of MD5 and SHA1 algorithms\n  to trust files and is required to enable ClamAV to operate legitimately in\n  FIPS-mode enabled environments.\n  Note: ClamAV may still calculate MD5 or SHA1 hashes as needed for detection\n  purposes or for informational purposes in FIPS-enabled environments and when\n  the FIPS-limits option is enabled.\n  GitHub pull request\n- Upgraded the clean-file scan cache to use SHA2-256 (prior versions use MD5).\n  The clean-file cache algorithm is not configurable.\n  This change resolves safety concerns over the use of MD5 to trust files and\n  is required to enable ClamAV to operate legitimately in FIPS-mode enabled\n  environments.\n  GitHub pull request #1\n  GitHub pull request #2\n- ClamD: Added an option to disable select administrative commands including\n  SHUTDOWN, RELOAD, STATS and VERSION.\n  The new clamd.conf options are:\n  EnableShutdownCommand yes\n  EnableReloadCommand yes\n  EnableStatsCommand yes\n  EnableVersionCommand yes\n  This change courtesy of GitHub user ChaoticByte.\n  GitHub pull request\n- libclamav: Added extended hashing functions with a \"flags\" parameter that\n  allows the caller to choose if they want to bypass FIPS hash algorithm limits:\n  cl_error_t cl_hash_data_ex(\n      const char *alg,\n      const uint8_t *data,\n      size_t data_len,\n      uint8_t **hash,\n      size_t *hash_len,\n      uint32_t flags);\n  cl_error_t cl_hash_init_ex(\n      const char *alg,\n      uint32_t flags,\n      cl_hash_ctx_t **ctx_out);\n  cl_error_t cl_update_hash_ex(\n      cl_hash_ctx_t *ctx,\n      const uint8_t *data,\n      size_t length);\n  cl_error_t cl_finish_hash_ex(\n      cl_hash_ctx_t *ctx,\n      uint8_t **hash,\n      size_t *hash_len,\n      uint32_t flags);\n  void cl_hash_destroy(void *ctx);\n  cl_error_t cl_hash_file_fd_ex(\n      const char *alg,\n      int fd,\n      size_t offset,\n      size_t length,\n      uint8_t **hash,\n      size_t *hash_len,\n      uint32_t flags);\n  GitHub pull request\n- ClamScan: Improved the precision of the bytes-scanned and bytes-read counters.\n  The ClamScan scan summary will now report exact counts in \"GiB\", \"MiB\", \"KiB\",\n  or \"B\" as appropriate. Previously, it always reported \"MB\".\n  GitHub pull request\n- ClamScan: Add hash & file-type in/out CLI options:\n  - --hash-hint: The file hash so that libclamav does not need to calculate\n    it. The type of hash must match the --hash-alg.\n  - --log-hash: Print the file hash after each file scanned. The type of hash\n    printed will match the --hash-alg.\n  - --hash-alg: The hashing algorithm used for either --hash-hint or\n    --log-hash. Supported algorithms are \"md5\", \"sha1\", \"sha2-256\".\n    If not specified, the default is \"sha2-256\".\n  - --file-type-hint: The file type hint so that libclamav can optimize\n    scanning (e.g., \"pe\", \"elf\", \"zip\", etc.). You may also use ClamAV type names\n    such as \"CL_TYPE_PE\". ClamAV will ignore the hint if it is not familiar with\n    the specified type.\n    See also: https://docs.clamav.net/appendix/FileTypes.html#file-types\n  - --log-file-type: Print the file type after each file scanned.\n  We will not be adding this for ClamDScan, as we do not have a mechanism in the\n  ClamD socket API to receive scan options or a way for ClamD to include scan\n  metadata in the response.\n  GitHub pull request\n- libclamav: Added new scan functions that provide additional functionality:\n  cl_error_t cl_scanfile_ex(\n      const char *filename,\n      cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,\n      const char **last_alert_out,\n      uint64_t *scanned_out,\n      const struct cl_engine *engine,\n      struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,\n      void *context,\n      const char *hash_hint,\n      char **hash_out,\n      const char *hash_alg,\n      const char *file_type_hint,\n      char **file_type_out);\n  cl_error_t cl_scandesc_ex(\n      int desc,\n      const char *filename,\n      cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,\n      const char **last_alert_out,\n      uint64_t *scanned_out,\n      const struct cl_engine *engine,\n      struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,\n      void *context,\n      const char *hash_hint,\n      char **hash_out,\n      const char *hash_alg,\n      const char *file_type_hint,\n      char **file_type_out);\n  cl_error_t cl_scanmap_ex(\n      cl_fmap_t *map,\n      const char *filename,\n      cl_verdict_t *verdict_out,\n      const char **last_alert_out,\n      uint64_t *scanned_out,\n      const struct cl_engine *engine,\n      struct cl_scan_options *scanoptions,\n      void *context,\n      const char *hash_hint,\n      char **hash_out,\n      const char *hash_alg,\n      const char *file_type_hint,\n      char **file_type_out);\n  The older cl_scan*() functions are now deprecated and may be removed in a\n  future release. See clamav.h for more details.\n  GitHub pull request\n- libclamav: Added a new engine option to toggle temp directory recursion.\n  Temp directory recursion is the idea that each object scanned in ClamAV's\n  recursive extract/scan process will get a new temp subdirectory, mimicking\n  the nesting structure of the file.\n  Temp directory recursion was introduced in ClamAV 0.103 and is enabled\n  whenever --leave-temps / LeaveTemporaryFiles is enabled.\n  In ClamAV 1.5, an application linking to libclamav can separately enable temp\n  directory recursion if they wish.\n  For ClamScan and ClamD, it will remain tied to --leave-temps /\n  LeaveTemporaryFiles options.\n  The new temp directory recursion option can be enabled with:\n  cl_engine_set_num(engine, CL_ENGINE_TMPDIR_RECURSION, 1);\n  GitHub pull request\n- libclamav: Added a class of scan callback functions that can be added with the\n  following API function:\n  void cl_engine_set_scan_callback(struct cl_engine *engine, clcb_scan callback, cl_scan_callback_t location);\n  The scan callback location may be configured using the following five values:\n  - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_PRE_HASH: Occurs just after basic file-type detection and\n    before any hashes have been calculated either for the cache or the gen-json\n    metadata.\n  - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_PRE_SCAN: Occurs before parser modules run and before\n    pattern matching.\n  - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_POST_SCAN: Occurs after pattern matching and after\n    running parser modules. A.k.a. the scan is complete for this layer.\n  - CL_SCAN_CALLBACK_ALERT: Occurs each time an alert (detection) would be\n    triggered during a scan.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.5.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.talosintelligence.com/","source":"Cisco Systems, Inc.","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
