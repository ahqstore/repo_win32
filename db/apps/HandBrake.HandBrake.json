HandBrake leverages tools such as FFmpeg, x264, and x265 to create new MP4 or MKV video files from these Sources.\nAll platforms\nVideo\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when encoding high depth video\nThird-party libraries\n- Updated libraries\n  - HarfBuzz 11.4.5 (subtitles)\n  - SVT-AV1 3.1.2 (AV1 video encoding)\nMac\n- Added a workaround to avoid a rare crash on Apple Silicon Macs\nWindows\n- Fixed some incorrect behaviour on CQ/RF calcuations and handling of presets\n- The app will now automatically disable QSV or NVDec decoders if an out-of-date driver is detected.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.10.2","version":0,"site":"https://handbrake.fr/","source":"The HandBrake Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
