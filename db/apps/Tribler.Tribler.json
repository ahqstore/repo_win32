Let's see this in a positive light and say that we are very popular (albeit with the wrong crowd).\n- Exitnodes have been blacklisted by ISPs.\n- The VPNs to introduce you to exit nodes have been blacklisted by ISPs.\n- Even the tribler.org website has been blacklisted by our DNS provider. You can find us on https://tribler.github.io/ now.\nThis release should come with the tools you need to get your anonymous downloads working again. For most users, this will mean that you can keep anonymously downloading as usual. Some of you that are deep in blacklisted zones may need to set your anonymous hop count to \"2\" from now on.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.3.1","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Tribler/tribler","source":"The Tribler Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
