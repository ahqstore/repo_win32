A zip-file is generated which can include a user provided \"README.md\".\n  - Added Telnet component.\n  - Added Metal graphics acceleration option.\n  - Added option to hide/show toolbar\n  - Improved drawing appearance.\n    - Fixed TTY appearance bug while changing various zoom levels.\n    - Corrected appearance of NOT gates in TikZ/SVG image export.\n    - Corrected disjoint corners in arrow-style Pins.\n    - Improved output of rectangles with rounded corners in TikZ image export.\n  - Fixed Undo/Redo issues.\n  - Fixed Power-on-Reset propagation issue.\n  - Redesigned simulation engine to fix synchronization issues and increase speed.\n    - Fixed synchronization and efficiency issues in wires and propagation.\n    - Fixed synchronization and efficiency issues in propagation listeners.\n    - Limited redraws to about 20 frames per second to reduce overhead.\n    - Allows users to choose a simulation queue, which changes the efficiency of the simulator depending on circuit design.\n  - Simplified Type and Behavior attributes of Pins.\n    - This change will break circuits with input pins that need to pull floating values to 0 but do not\n      have the Pull Down setting. To fix it, set the Behavior attribute to Pull Down.\n    - Updated Pin documentation.\n  - Subcircuits with clock input(s) are now drawn with a clock symbol.\n  - Added TTL 74194: 4-bit bidirectional universal shift register.\n  - Improved the English, French, and German localization. Smaller fixes were done to the other languages as well.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/logisim-evolution","source":"logisim-evolution developers","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
