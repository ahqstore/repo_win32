It is not definitive, but we will probably end support for Windows 7 and 8 in first half of the 2026*. Older NetLimiter versions (like the one currently realesed) will still run on old machines, but new updates won't.\n\nNew features\n- New improved tray icon functionality.\n- Added tray icon widget with various tools and infos.\n- Many more texts translated to all supported languages. (If you find any translation problem, please contact us at support@netlimiter.com)\n- Added Pause option to Traffic chart.\nFixed bugs\n- Traffic chart rare synchorinization bug fixed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.3.26.0","version":0,"site":"https://netlimiter.com/","source":"Locktime Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
