VCF is a file type recognized by desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. These files primarily store names and phone numbers in order to export and import contacts.

A dedicated software tool such as Vovsoft VCF to CSV Converter can help you in this regard. This program supports a wide variety of VCF formats including iCloud, Android, Google Contacts, and Outlook.\n\nDesigned with simplicity in mind, \"VCF to CSV Converter\" can only perform one task: that of extracting the contacts from the input VCF container, then transferring it to a newly created Comma Separated Values (.csv) file anywhere on your computer.\n\nThere are many online websites that can convert vCards. However they have upload limitations. The best part of the program is that the conversion is fast and done completely offline. You are the only controller of your private data. No contact information is sent to internet in any case.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.6.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
