And it lets you enjoy them in remarkably high quality.\nIt’s a multimedia platform.\nVideo from your digital camera or mobile phone. A movie on your Mac or PC. A media clip on a website. No matter what you're watching or where you're watching it, QuickTime technology makes it all possible.\nIt’s a sophisticated media player.\nWith its simple design and easy-to-use controls, QuickTime Player makes everything you watch even more enjoyable.

A handy slider lets you set playback from 1/2x to 3x the normal speed.
