No SDDL knowledge required!\n- Query services on the local machine or on remote machines\n- View permissions on the Service Control Manager itself (scmanager)\n- Copy the SDDL format of any service's permissions to your clipboard, for use with other tools\n- More features coming in full release after BETA\nMinor bug fixes and UI improvements","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.5.2","version":0,"site":"https://cjwdev.com/","source":"Cjwdev","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
