Insert the microSD card you’ll use with your Raspberry Pi into the reader and run Raspberry Pi Imager.\n✨ Features\nPerformance\n- Add direct I/O bypass for Linux (O_DIRECT), macOS (F_NOCACHE), and Windows (FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING) to reduce memory pressure during writes\n- Add zero-copy ring buffer for data transfer between download and write threads, reducing CPU overhead\n- Add asynchronous cache file writer to overlap download and disk I/O operations\n- Dynamically adjust write queue depth based on available system memory, tuned for more aggressive performance\n- Add sequential read hints (FADV_SEQUENTIAL, F_RDAHEAD) during verification for better prefetching\n- Track detailed performance metrics for network, decompression, and write phases\n- Use Windows IOCTLs (IOCTL_DISK_DELETE_DRIVE_LAYOUT) for faster disk preparation instead of diskpart\n- Add performance data analysis tool for debugging slow writes (Press CTRL + SHIFT + P, save the JSON, attach to a new Issue).\nDrive Handling\n- Switch drive polling from fixed 1-second interval to adaptive mode (fast during selection, paused during writes)\n- Fix NVMe namespace detection on Linux to correctly identify NVMe drives by parsing /sys/class/nvme/\n- Suppress Windows \"Insert a disk\" error dialog when accessing empty removable drives\n- Fix macOS APFS volume handling to correctly identify child partitions\n- Allow virtual disks to be treated as 'system' drives on Windows & Linux (macOS was supported from 2.0.0)\nUser Interface\n- Add password field component with show/hide toggle button\n- Add type-to-search in combo boxes with backspace support to delete characters\n- Add Enter key to open combo box dropdown when focused\n- Show device and OS names with tooltips when text is truncated\n- Restructure countdown timer before write confirmation dialog can be accepted\n- Fix bottom padding in write confirmation dialog\n- Reintroduce multiple SSH key support\nAccessibility\n- Add proper focus order and keyboard navigation for screen readers across all dialogs\n- Move accessibility description properties to centralized form label component\nmacOS\n- Add file type filter popup to native save dialogs (matching Finder behavior)\n- Request location permission asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI when detecting WiFi networks\n- Add dark mode, tinted and clear Liquid Glass icon variants using Icon Composer for proper menu bar appearance\nLinux\n- Fix X11 authorization when running AppImage as root via xhost and proper XAUTHORITY handling\n- Install scalable SVG icon instead of fixed-size PNG for better HiDPI support\nWindows\n- Migrate file dialogs from legacy GetOpenFileName API to modern IFileDialog COM interface\n- Fix file dialog filter string requiring double-null termination\n- Fix scroll direction on ImComboBox\nCustomization\n- Allow SSH public key authentication without requiring a username/password to be set\n- Fix missing user creation block when not enabling SSH\nNetworking\n- Add automatic fallback from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 after repeated failures\n- Log HTTP protocol version used on successful downloads\n- Skip error dialogs when user cancels download mid-transfer\n- Properly close file handles when operations are cancelled\nOther\n- Add file logging support (--log-file command line argument)\n- Re-use ring buffer memory for SHA256 verification instead of allocating new buffers\n- Validate init_format field in OS list JSON and log warnings for invalid entries\n- Extract clean version string (X.Y.Z) for telemetry instead of full build string\n- Add privilege escalation support for elevatable application bundles\n🐛 Bug Fixes\n- Fix SSH key file dialog filter on Windows (was passing list instead of string)\n- Fix Italian translation inconsistencies\n- Fix icon installation path for Linux desktop integration\n- Fix cloud-init user-data generation for Pi Connect configuration\n- Remove O_SYNC flag from file operations (was causing unnecessary performance penalty)\n🌍 Internationalization\n- Add Romanian translation\n- Add Italian translation\n- Add Czech translation\n- Updated Russian translation\n- Updated French translation\n- Update translations for new MacFile and NativeFileDialog strings\n- Add en-US translation\n🎨 Icons\n- New Windows and Linux application icons\n- macOS icon with light/dark mode variants\n- Add scripts to regenerate platform icons from source SVG\nWhat's Changed\n- 2.0.2: Refinement by @tdewey-rpi in #1314\n- Romanian translation added by @valimaties in #1350\n- Update Portuguese translation by @hugok79 in #1353\n- Translate strings into French by @martignoni in #1323\n- Czech translation added by @walken11 in #1375\nNew Contributors\n- @valimaties made their first contribution in #1350\n- @walken11 made their first contribution in #1375\nFull Changelog:
