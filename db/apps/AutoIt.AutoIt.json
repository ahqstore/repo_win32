It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys). AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on all versions of Windows out-of-the-box with no annoying \"runtimes\" required!\nAutoIt was initially designed for PC \"roll out\" situations to reliably automate and configure thousands of PCs. Over time it has become a powerful language that supports complex expressions, user functions, loops and everything else that veteran scripters would expect. Features:\n- Easy to learn BASIC-like syntax\n- Simulate keystrokes and mouse movements\n- Manipulate windows and processes\n- Interact with all standard windows controls\n- Scripts can be compiled into standalone executables\n- Create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)\n- COM support\n- Regular expressions\n- Directly call external DLL and Windows API functions\n- Scriptable RunAs functions\n- Detailed helpfile and large community-based support forums\n- Compatible with Windows XP SP3 / 2003 SP2 / Vista / 2008 / Windows 7 / 2008 R2 / Windows 8 / 2012 R2\n- Unicode and x64 support\n- Digitally signed for peace of mind\n- Works with Windows User Account Control (UAC)\nAutoIt has been designed to be as small as possible and stand-alone with no external .dll files or registry entries required making it safe to use on Servers.
