It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys). AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on all versions of Windows out-of-the-box with no annoying \"runtimes\" required!\nAutoIt was initially designed for PC \"roll out\" situations to reliably automate and configure thousands of PCs. Over time it has become a powerful language that supports complex expressions, user functions, loops and everything else that veteran scripters would expect. Features:\n- Easy to learn BASIC-like syntax\n- Simulate keystrokes and mouse movements\n- Manipulate windows and processes\n- Interact with all standard windows controls\n- Scripts can be compiled into standalone executables\n- Create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)\n- COM support\n- Regular expressions\n- Directly call external DLL and Windows API functions\n- Scriptable RunAs functions\n- Detailed helpfile and large community-based support forums\n- Compatible with Windows XP SP3 / 2003 SP2 / Vista / 2008 / Windows 7 / 2008 R2 / Windows 8 / 2012 R2\n- Unicode and x64 support\n- Digitally signed for peace of mind\n- Works with Windows User Account Control (UAC)\nAutoIt has been designed to be as small as possible and stand-alone with no external .dll files or registry entries required making it safe to use on Servers. Scripts can be compiled into stand-alone executables with Aut2Exe.\nAlso supplied is a combined COM and DLL version of AutoIt called AutoItX that allows you to add the unique features of AutoIt to your own favorite scripting or programming languages!\nAutoIt:\n- Changed: Windows 7/Server 2008 is now the minimum OS version required due to dev environment changes.\n- Added #3891: DllCall() performance optimisation.\n- Added: Standard Windows Fonts List for Win10/Win11.\n- Added #3906: GUICtrlCreateXXX creation in example assign to $idXXX to reflect Ctrl type.\n- Added: FileGetAttrib() retrieve Join folder (J) as created by FileCreateNTFSLink().\n- Added: Split WindowsConstants.u3 in WindowsNotifsConstants.au3, WindowsStylesConstants.au3 and WindowsSysColor.au3.\n- Added: #3984: GUICtrlSetGraphic() doc precision.\n- Added: operator precedence doc precision.\n- Fixed: Doc Chr(0) handling inside functions.\n- Fixed #3923: Doc typo in \"Send Key List\".\n- Fixed: Regression #3135 handle leak (Thanks Nano, Rudi, Nine).\n- Fixed #3925: Doc With ...
