Sandboxes provides a secure way to give agents autonomy without compromising your system.\n\nAI agents need to execute commands, install packages, and test code. Running them directly on your host machine means they have full access to your files, processes, and network. Docker Sandboxes isolates agents in microVMs, each with its own Docker daemon. Agents can spin up test containers and modify their environment without affecting your host.\n\nYou get:\n- Agent autonomy without host system risk\n- YOLO mode by default - agents work without asking permission\n- Private Docker daemon for running test containers\n- File sharing between host and sandbox\n- Network access control\n- Automated image caching so you don't re-download the image all the time\n- Shell mode for blank coding agent sandbox\n- OpenCode Support\n- Support for mounting multiple Workspaces\n- Support for running in WSL2\n- Implicitly start sandbox in CWD if no path provided","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.12.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.docker.com/","source":"Docker Inc","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
