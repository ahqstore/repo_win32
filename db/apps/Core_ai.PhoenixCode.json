We tried to sustain development through community donations (Open Collective), but over the last few years it hasn’t been enough to support full-time work - and we reached a hard choice: slow down drastically, or find a sustainable path that keeps Phoenix Code healthy.\nSo we’re introducing Phoenix Pro as an optional way to support Phoenix Code’s future - with one Pro feature: Live Preview Edit.\nIf Phoenix Code has helped you, Phoenix Pro is a way to help keep the project moving forward.\nStudents & educators get Phoenix Pro for Education at no cost, because we want classrooms to have easy access to modern, easy-to-use development tooling.
