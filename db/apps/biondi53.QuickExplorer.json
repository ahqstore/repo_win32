The file list remains invisible for a few milliseconds until it has correctly calculated its column count and target scroll position, eliminating jarring layout shifts.\n- ⚡ Sub-Pixel Precision: Added a mathematical tolerance (+50% height center) to scroll detection, preventing the scroll position from \"creeping\" upward due to browser sub-pixel rounding errors.\n- Race Condition Guard: Fixed a critical bug where the grid would jump exponentially downwards on mount by preventing scroll restoration until the container width is fully measured.\n- Smooth Tab Restoration: Refined the tab-switching logic to ensure that restored scroll positions are rock-solid and never interrupted by automatic selection scroll.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.1.19","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/biondi53","source":"biondi53","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
