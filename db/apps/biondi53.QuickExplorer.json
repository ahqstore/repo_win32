Commands now return immediately, preventing UI freezes during long-running operations.\n- Event-Driven UI Refresh: High-performance \"refresh-on-completion\" using Tauri events (refresh-tab), ensuring the UI stays in sync without blocking the user.\n- IFileOperation Modernization: Full migration to the modern Windows API for all core file operations (Copy, Move, Rename, Delete, New Folder).\n🛡️ Stability & Modality Improvements\n- Input Synchronization: Integrated AttachThreadInput to properly transfer focus from the STA worker to the main window.\n- Smart Window Disabling: Refined the run_modal mechanism to disable the app window ONLY when a system dialog is active, preventing accidental interactions.\n🛠️ Internal Optimizations\n- Type Safety & Reliability: Fixed OLE imports and type ambiguities in the Rust backend.\n- STA Worker Health: Improved thread management and error handling for background tasks.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.1.14","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/biondi53","source":"biondi53","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
