This meant that if any new files were uploaded with names that hadn't previously existed in S3, the launcher would error.\nThis patch applies the new naming scheme in the required locations of the launcher code.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.3.1","site":"https://github.com/CorporateClash","source":"Corporate Clash","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
