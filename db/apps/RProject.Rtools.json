This fixes security vulnerability CVE-2025-1094 in PostgreSQL. The vulnerability allows SQL injection and arbitrary code execution via crafted input data, involving strategically placed invalid UTF-8 characters. It could happen when input quoted by PostgreSQL is passed to the interactive PostgreSQL terminal tool, psql.exe, which is part of Rtools.\nTo safely avoid these atacks, R packages linking to PostgreSQL libraries can be re-installed using this version of Rtools. While probably unlikely, if any application directly used psql.exe from Rtools, this update can be installed to be on the safe side.\nThere is no other change in the toolchain nor libraries provided in this update. Like any update of Rtools, also this one includes the current build tools from Msys2, and those can be easily updated via pacman directly without installing an update of Rtools.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.4.6459","site":"https://www.r-project.org/","source":"The R Foundation","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
