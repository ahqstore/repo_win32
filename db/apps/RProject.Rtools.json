Gdal has been fixed to really include blosc support. Cmake files for gdal and several other packages have been fixed.\nCurl has a new dependency, secur32 (from Windows), hence packages using curl need to be updated, unless they are already using pkg-config. No CRAN packages are affected, maintainers of two Bioconductor packages have been provided with patches.\nThe Tcl/Tk bundle has been updated to version 8.16.17 (and BWidget to 1.10.1).\nUpstream MXE changes have been merged from 2ffe7bb05ce08a036cc1e39bdd6962e19e0f6321. and additional packages have been updated as detailed below:\narmadillo 12.8.4 to 15.0.3\ncmake-host 3.30.4 to 3.31.8\ncurl 8.13.0 to 8.16.0\neigen 3.4.0 to 5.0.0\nexpat 2.7.1 to 2.7.3\nffmpeg 7.1.1 to 7.1.2\nflint 3.2.2 to 3.3.1\nfluidsynth 2.4.6 to 2.4.8\nfontconfig 2.16.0 to 2.17.1\nfreetype 2.13.3 to 2.14.1\nfreetype-bootstrap 2.13.3 to 2.14.1\ngcc 14.2.0 to 14.3.0\ngcc-host 14.2.0 to 14.3.0\ngdal 3.11.0 to 3.11.4\ngdk-pixbuf 2.42.12 to 2.44.3\ngettext 0.25 to 0.26\nglib 2.85.0 to 2.86.0\ngnutls 3.8.9 to 3.8.10\ngrpc 1.70.1 to 1.70.2\nharfbuzz 11.2.1 to 12.1.0\nimagemagick 7.1.1-47 to 7.1.2-5\nintel-tbb 2022.1.0 to 2022.2.0\njasper 4.2.5 to 4.2.8\nlibarchive 3.8.0 to 3.8.1\nlibffi 3.4.8 to 3.5.2\nlibgcrypt 1.11.1 to 1.11.2\nlibgit2 1.9.0 to 1.9.1\nlibgpg_error 1.55 to 1.56\nlibheif 1.19.8 to 1.20.2\nlibidn 1.42 to 1.43\nlibpng 1.6.48 to 1.6.50\nlibssh 0.11.1 to 0.11.3\nlibunistring 1.3 to 1.4.1\nlibvpx 1.15.1 to 1.15.2\nlibwebp 1.5.0 to 1.6.0\nlibzmq 34f7fa2 to 7a7bfa1\nnghttp2 1.65.0 to 1.67.1\nogg 1.3.5 to 1.3.6\nopenblas 0.3.29 to 0.3.30\nopencv 4.11.0 to 4.12.0\nopenjpeg 2.5.3 to 2.5.4\nopenssl 3.5.0 to 3.6.0\npango 1.56.3 to 1.57.0\npcre2 10.45 to 10.46\npixman 0.46.0 to 0.46.4\npoppler 25.05.0 to 25.10.0\npostgresql 16.9 to 16.10\nproj 9.6.0 to 9.7.0\nprotobuf 29.3 to 29.5\nquantlib 1.38 to 1.39\nre2 2024-07-02 to 2025-08-12\nreadline 8.2 to 8.3\nsqlite 3490200 to 3500400\ntiff 4.7.0 to 4.7.1\nx264 373697b4 to b35605ac\nPackage opusfile 0.11 has been added.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.5.6691","version":0,"site":"https://www.r-project.org/","source":"The R Foundation","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
