It functions as an automated code review tool to identify problematic code patterns early in the development cycle.\n\nKey Features and Strengths\n- PVS-Studio offers several features for integrating static analysis into development workflows:\n- Advanced Analysis Technologies: Employs data-flow analysis, symbolic execution, taint analysis, and intermodular analysis for deep code inspection.\n- Seamless Integration: Works within popular IDEs (Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, Rider, Qt Creator) and integrates into CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, TeamCity, SonarQube).\n- Legacy Code Support: Features a mass suppression mechanism to suppress warnings on existing code, allowing teams to focus on new code immediately.\n- Safety and Compliance: Supports coding standards like MISRA, AUTOSAR, SEI CERT, and OWASP for safety and security-critical environments.\n\nPVS-Studio is licensed commercially but offers free options for open-source projects, students, teachers, and closed-source developers who agree to place comments in their code.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.39.99095.2022","version":0,"site":"https://pvs-studio.com/","source":"PVS-Studio LLC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
