Offering low latency,\nnative client resolution, cloud gaming server capabilities with support for AMD, Intel, and\nNvidia GPUs for hardware encoding. Software encoding is also available. A web UI is provided to\nallow configuration and client pairing from your favorite web browser. Pair from the local server\nor any mobile device.\nChange log\n1. Display mode override: Wiki\n2. Remote Input: App name will remain the same when remote input is enabled and a session is on going. This can make MoonDeck to resume properly.\n3. Config file will try to migrate again if it failed to load somehow. It's better not to downgrade to pre-0.3.0 versions if you have upgraded.\n4. SudoVDA upgrade:\n- better handling for fractional refresh rates\n- removed built-in 59.94 option (use override instead)\n- HDR minimal black level is now 0\nðŸŒŸBest practices\n1. If your client support high refresh rate, always use high refresh rate. Combined with Artemis's Warp modes, this is basically a poorman's GSync/FreeSync.\n2. If some of your clients have periodic stuttering happening, check if there display refresh rate isn't actually the value you expect by going to https://www.testufo.com/refreshrate . Then you can set Display Mode Override for the client in PIN page.\nWarning\nIt is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.\nNote\nVirusTotal scan report for this build\nWhy Windows always report file as harmful?","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.3.1-hotfox.1","site":"https://github.com/ClassicOldSong","source":"Yukino Song","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
