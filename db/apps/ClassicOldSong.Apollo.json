Offering low latency,\nnative client resolution, cloud gaming server capabilities with support for AMD, Intel, and\nNvidia GPUs for hardware encoding. Software encoding is also available. A web UI is provided to\nallow configuration and client pairing from your favorite web browser. Pair from the local server\nor any mobile device.\nChange log\n1. Better frame pacing for capture refresh rate limiter (for unaligned frames)\n2. Fix the problem that stream can get freezes when using Input Only mode\n3. Fix usage with libdisplaydevice(may break Windows 10)\n4. Supports fractional refresh rate from client (needs Artemis v12.1.250410 or above)\n5. Improved translation for PT-BR. Thanks @bestknighter !\n6. Improved translation for SV. Thanks @roos-robert !\n7. Improved text encoding handling for logs\n8. Fix a rare case that config migration from older versions/Sunshine can fail\n9. Adds a template image for customizing game/app cover. Thanks @ryanbbernstein !\nðŸŒŸBest practices\n1. If your client support high refresh rate, always use high refresh rate. Combined with Artemis's Warp modes, this is basically a poorman's GSync/FreeSync.\n2. If some of your clients have periodic stuttering happening, check if there display refresh rate isn't actually the value you expect by going to https://www.testufo.com/refreshrate . Then you can set Display Mode Override for the client in PIN page.\nWarning\nIt is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.\nRemember to quit Apollo before upgrading.\nNote\nVirusTotal scan report for this build\nWhy Windows always report file as harmful?","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.3.3","site":"https://github.com/ClassicOldSong","source":"Yukino Song","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
