This Windows-based application acts as a staging area for creating and setting up new Intralinks VDRs and modifying existing VDRs.\nUsing Intralinks Designer, you can:\n- Create new VDRs\n- Make changes to VDR settings\n- Add new content from your local drives\n- View and update existing VDR content\n- Reorder VDR content items\n- Delete content from the Intralinks VDR\n- Set users’ permissions to use documents\n- Add, remove and synchronize user information with other databases\n- Configure and manage custom fields for documents, as well as apply these fields to new and existing documents\nWhen you have finished staging the VDR and updating user information, you can upload the new or modified information to the Intralinks primary service.\nUsing Intralinks Designer, you can index and freeze VDR s. You can use the indexing feature to clearly order your content and as a way to easily reference to specific content. For example, you can distinguish among exact copies of the same document in multiple locations on your VDR by its unique index number. Freezing a VDR in Intralinks Designer enables you to retain the order of existing VDR content.\nIntralinks Designer can be used by VDR managers (those with the Manager Plus, Hidden Manager Plus and Manager roles) and those with the Publisher Plus role.\n- A new setting allows Filesplit users to choose whether they want to receive copies of notifications sent to investors when documents are posted. If the setting is unmarked, the Send me a copy option is unmarked by default during posting, but the user can mark the option if they want to receive the notification.\n- Hyperlinks and /tab characters are no longer allowed when documents and folders are added or updated.\n- Hyperlinks and the following special characters are no longer allowed when groups are created or updated: / \\ : * \" < > ? | and tab characters.\n- Resolved issue: An error that occurred while updating Intralinks Designer and then prevented users from logging in has been resolved.\n- Resolved issue: A performance issue that occurred in Filesplit when more than 100 postings were posted in shared mode on a shared drive has been fixed.\n- Resolved issue: Permissions were not activated as expected for Filesplit postings to a very large exchange, and permissions needed to be set manually. That issue is resolved.\n- Resolved issue: Intralinks Designer no longer freezes when loading Filesplit postings from a network drive in shared mode.\n- Resolved issue: Issues with slowness when loading Filesplit postings and postings getting stuck have been fixed.\n- Resolved issue: An intermittent error that occurred during the Filesplit posting process has been fixed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.23.0.2846","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Intralinks","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
