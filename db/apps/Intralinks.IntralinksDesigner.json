This Windows-based application acts as a staging area for creating and setting up new Intralinks VDRs and modifying existing VDRs.\nUsing Intralinks Designer, you can:\n- Create new VDRs\n- Make changes to VDR settings\n- Add new content from your local drives\n- View and update existing VDR content\n- Reorder VDR content items\n- Delete content from the Intralinks VDR\n- Set users’ permissions to use documents\n- Add, remove and synchronize user information with other databases\n- Configure and manage custom fields for documents, as well as apply these fields to new and existing documents\nWhen you have finished staging the VDR and updating user information, you can upload the new or modified information to the Intralinks primary service.\nUsing Intralinks Designer, you can index and freeze VDR s. You can use the indexing feature to clearly order your content and as a way to easily reference to specific content. For example, you can distinguish among exact copies of the same document in multiple locations on your VDR by its unique index number. Freezing a VDR in Intralinks Designer enables you to retain the order of existing VDR content.\nIntralinks Designer can be used by VDR managers (those with the Manager Plus, Hidden Manager Plus and Manager roles) and those with the Publisher Plus role.\n- Intralinks Designer now supports Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) and Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OS primary account.\n- Resolved issue: After an Intralinks Designer update, a user encountered multiple problems because of a corrupted dictionary file. Changes were made to ensure that if a dictionary file becomes corrupted in the future, it will be automatically replaced.\n- Resolved issue: Filesplit users can select groups whose names contain special characters. A change was introduced in a previous release that prevents new groups from being created with special characters in their names; after this change, users were no longer able to select older groups if their names contained special characters. Users now can select both the old groups whose names may include special characters and new groups whose names cannot include special characters.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.23.1.2881","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Intralinks","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
