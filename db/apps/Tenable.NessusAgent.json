As a result, Tenable Agent 11.0.1 is the first release in the Tenable Agent 11 series.\n- You can upgrade to the latest version of Tenable Agent from any previously supported version.\n- If your upgrade path skips versions of the Tenable Agent, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.\n- If you are connecting to Tenable Vulnerability Management through Tenable Nessus scanners, Tenable Agents, Tenable Web App Scanning scanners, or Tenable Network Monitors (NNM) located in mainland China, you must connect through sensor.cloud.tenablecloud.cn instead of sensor.cloud.tenable.com.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"11.0.1.20008","version":0,"site":"https://www.tenable.com/","source":"Tenable, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
