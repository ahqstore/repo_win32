On start up, WinDirStat reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:\n- The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,\n- The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,\n- The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.\nSee the CHANGELOG for release details.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.2.0","site":"https://windirstat.net/","source":"The WinDirStat Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
