Nowadays, the resolution of pictures taken by digital cameras can be very high. It is fine when you want to view them, or print them out. But when it comes to share them with your friends or colleagues, it’s better to shrink them with an image resizer: it will take less time to upload on social medias, take less space on smartphones, but still let everyone enjoy your photos. XnResize helps you to do that : It lets you lower the resolution, and convert your photos to more size-efficient formats. All common picture and graphic formats are supported (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, WEBP, PSD, JPEG2000, OpenEXR, camera RAW, HEIC, PDF, DNG, CR2).\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.11","version":0,"site":"https://www.xnview.com/en/","source":"Gougelet Pierre-e","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
