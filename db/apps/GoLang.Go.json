Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.\ngo1.25.6 (released 2026-01-15) includes security fixes to the go command, and the archive/zip, crypto/tls, and net/url packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler, the runtime, and the crypto/tls, errors, and os packages. See the Go 1.25.6 milestone on our issue tracker for details.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.25.6","version":0,"site":"https://go.dev/","source":"https://go.dev","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
