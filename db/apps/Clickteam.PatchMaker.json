One version differs from the previous one by a small number of\nchanges. Some sections of code in the executable files are different, new files\nmay be added, some even deleted. What the author of the product usually does is\nprovide a whole new version of the files either as a new reinstallable product\nor just the modified files, compressed into an installer.\n\nThe above procedure is very wasteful though. For example, if a file of 1\nmegabyte has only had say 10 kilobytes altered inside it, then why create an\nupdate patch that requires the full 1 megabyte? It would be far more efficient\nif just the altered data was stored. This is the purpose of Patch Maker, as it\nsaves a huge amount of bytes by storing just the differences between files and\neven compressing this data.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.3b","version":0,"site":"https://www.clickteam.com/about-clickteam","source":"Clickteam","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
