Small projects of 5 stories or fewer dominate the structures built nationwide and this is where our software excels.\nENERCALC is designed to help you complete 90% of your structural engineering design work – while simplifying the process as much as possible. You’ll find a consistent user interface, colors, fonts, and workflow across each module. This consistency produces a familiarity similar to the muscle memory you develop while training for a sport.\nENERCALC provides the practicing engineer with a large toolkit of capabilities to design the elements of structures and also provides an environment to develop sets of project engineering calculations that contain other project files you create or reference, such as EXCEL spreadsheets, WORD documents, PDF files, scanned images, and general project information.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"20.25.10.02","site":"https://enercalc.com/","source":"ENERCALC, LLC.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
