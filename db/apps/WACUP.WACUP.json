My plan is to include bug fixes, updates of existing features & most importantly new features with the goal to eventually become its own highly compatible media player.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.99.36.22278","version":0,"site":"https://getwacup.com/","source":"Darren Owen aka DrO","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
