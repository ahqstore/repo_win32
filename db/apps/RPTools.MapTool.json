It is also a good idea to always have backups.\nNote: Do not install over the top of an old version; either install it in a new directory or uninstall the old version first. If you have installed a beta version of 1.16.0, uninstall that first.\nPlatform Notes\nWe strongly encourage you to use the installer format for your operating system. The JAR file should only be used by advanced users comfortable installing Java releases. You need to install a working Java with JavaFX on your system to use it.\nNote: if using Ubuntu, you will need Ubuntu 24.04 or later, as the dependencies are not available for earlier versions\nmacOS: Use either .pkg (recommended) or .dmg.\n- On macOS, to run the app the first time after installation, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and continue to hold Ctrl while choosing Open, then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).\n- The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken. For more details, see #2679.\nWhat's Changed Since 1.16.1\nBug Fixes 🩹\n- 1.16 - Fix bad FoW check in PointerTool by @kwvanderlinde in #5309\n- Fix hex grid dimensions when reading from GridDto by @kwvanderlinde in #5310\n- 1.16 - Make tooltips show again for drawing tools, fog of war tools, and topology tools by @kwvanderlinde in #5315\n- 1.16 - fix map dragging for drawing tools and expose tools by @kwvanderlinde in #5314\nWhat's Changed Since 1.15.2\nNew Features 🥳\n- BoardTool upgraded to control map image scale by @bubblobill in #4861\n- Added ability to load MRU campaign at startup by @bubblobill in #4870\n- Return JSON on rest failure to mtscript instead of exception by @Jmr3366 in #4896\n- Bind getBar, setBar isBarVisible and setBarVisible to javascript by @fishface60 in #4899\n- Add a Handlebars LibraryTemplateLoader and rework file loading to support partial templates by @fishface60 in #4921\n- Restrict each drawable light to its lumens level by @kwvanderlinde in #4940\n- Add base64Encode handlebars helper by @fishface60 in #4925\n- Added hotkey macro button properties to metamacro functions by @bubblobill in #4970\n- Do not show local player in Connections window or status panel by @kwvanderlinde in #4983\n- Changed behaviour of adding token property.
