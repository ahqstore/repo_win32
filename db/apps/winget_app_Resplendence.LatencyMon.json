LatencyMon analyzes the possible causes of buffer underruns by measuring kernel timer latencies and reporting DPC and ISR execution times as well as hard pagefaults. It will provide a comprehensible report and find the kernel modules and processes responsible for causing audio latencies which result in drop outs. It also provides the functionality of an ISR monitor, DPC monitor and a hard pagefault monitor.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.31","site":"https://www.resplendence.com/main","source":"Resplendence Software Projects Sp.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
