The respective Character's checkbox will no longer affect Room Objects.\n- Fixed editor not being able to find a event function in script if there was a comment on the same line as a function declaration.\n- Fixed bad script generated for Global Variables of String array type.\n- Fixed editor was suggesting Room 301 as a first non-state-saving room, while 300 is the one.\n- Fixed a error in \"New Room\" and \"Change Room Number\" dialogs where having number 300 and ticking \"don't save state\" checkbox would cause \"value out of range\" exception.\n- Fixed \"Show sprite usage\" did not account for Slider's background image.\n- Fixed text input fields on Colour Finder and Lip Sync panels did not fallback to the default text field setting in Color Theme in case their individual settings were missing.\nCompiler:\n- Fixed a crash caused by meeting certain unicode characters in script (outside of string or character literals).\nEngine:\n- When a room state restored from a save has a different number of Room Objects, it will be automatically fixed to match the number of Objects found in the current game's room.\n- Removed error triggered if a Wait or any similar \"waiting\" command was called in the starting room's \"Before fade-in\" event. For some reason this error was only shown if it's the first room in the game, which does not make much sense. There's still a warning logged in this circumstance.\n- Fixed magenta color on room background could be treated as transparent when it's a part of a walk-behind (regression in 3.6.2).\n- Fixed switching display modes while running a 16-bit game could lead to current graphical overlays (like character portraits, etc) become corrupted.\n- Fixed engine to not automatically switch from an empty view loop when animating character by command (should only do that when animating walking).\n- Fixed text height calculation did not account for the outline font's size (only for automatic outlining).\n- Fixed standard dialog options surface had excessive height (regression in 3.6.2).\n- Fixed mouse cursor may not get updated after \"Before fade-in\" event if there was a Display function called in it.\n- Fixed function such as Game.ScanSaveSlots(), ListBox.FillSaveGameList(), and similar, wrongly error when a single-slot range is passed (min slot = max slot).\n- Fixed a potential crash occuring when engine was trying to log a warning in case a invalid font was assigned to a Game's or GUIControl's Font property.\n- Fixed engine overwriting existing translations when duplicate keys are found in the translation file (it should keep the first met translation instead).\n- Fixed engine to not try to translate empty lines. There was a rare error when the translation contained an incorrect entry with empty key line but non-empty translation, in which case engine could display that \"translation\" anytime any label has empty text.\nWinSetup:\n- Fixed \"Translation\" option always reset to default when starting the setup program.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.6.2.13","site":"https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/","source":"AGS Project Team","license_or_tos":"Artistic License 2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
