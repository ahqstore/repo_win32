TigerVNC provides the levels of performance necessary to run 3D and video applications, and it attempts to maintain a common look and feel and re-use components, where possible, across the various platforms that it supports. TigerVNC also provides extensions for advanced authentication methods and TLS encryption.\nThe bugfix release TigerVNC 1.14.1 is now available. This release fixes a number of regressions, the most prominent being:\n- Default installation of native viewer can once again handle VncAuth\n- Graphic acceleration now can now be disabled through the vncserver config file the same way as other features\n- Command vncpasswd can again correctly update passwords\n- Native viewer once again consider passwd file that contain more than one password valid\n- Native viewer can once again connect to RealVNC servers\n- Users of x0vncserver should no longer experience the mouse cursor moving to the upper left corner\n- H264 encoding no longer causes crashing","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.14.1","site":"https://tigervnc.org/","source":"TigerVNC project","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
