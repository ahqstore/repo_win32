It is aimed at Haskellers both new and experienced.\n\n\nSee https://haskellstack.org/ for installation and upgrade instructions.\nChanges since v3.7.1:\nBehavior changes:\n- Where applicable and Stack supports the GHC version, only the wired-in packages of the actual version of GHC used are treated as wired-in packages.\n- Stack now recognises ghc-internal as a GHC wired-in package.\n- The configuration option package-index has a new default value: the keyids key lists the keys of the Hackage root key holders applicable from 2025-07-24.\n- Stack's dot command now treats --depth the same way as the ls dependencies command, so that the nodes of stack dot --external --depth 0 are the same as the packages listed by stack ls dependencies --depth 0.\n- When building GHC from source, on Windows, the default Hadrian build target is reloc-binary-dist and the default path to the GHC built by Hadrian is _build/reloc-bindist.\n- Stack's haddock command no longer requires a package to have a main library that exposes modules.\n- On Windows, the path segment platform\\hash\\ghc version, under .stack-work\\install and .stack-work\\hoogle, is hashed only once, rather than twice.\nOther enhancements:\n- Bump to Hpack 0.39.1.\n- Consider GHC 9.14 to be a tested compiler and remove warnings.\n- Consider Cabal 3.16 to be a tested library and remove warnings.\n- From GHC 9.12.1, base is not a GHC wired-in package. In configuration files, the notify-if-base-not-boot key is introduced, to allow the exisitng notification to be muted if unwanted when using such GHC versions.\n- Add flag --[no-]omit-this (default: disabled) to Stack's clean command to omit directories currently in use from cleaning (when --full is not specified).\n- Add option -w as synonym for --stack-yaml.\n- stack new now allows codeberg: as a service for template downloads\n- In YAML configuration files, the compiler-target and compiler-bindist-path keys are introduced to allow, when building GHC from source, the Hadrian build target and Hadrian path to the built GHC to be specified.\nBug fixes:\n- --PROG-option=<argument> passes --PROG-option=<argument> (and not --PROG-option=\"<argument>\") to Cabal (the library).\n- The message S-7151 now presents as an error, with advice, and not as a bug.\n- Stack's dot command now uses a box to identify all GHC wired-in packages, not just those with no dependencies (being only rts).\n- Stack's dot command now gives all nodes with no dependencies in the graph the maximum rank, not just those nodes with no relevant dependencies at all (being only rts, when --external is specified).\n- Improved error messages for S-4634 and S-8215.\n- Improved in-app help for the --hpack-force flag.\nThanks to all our contributors for this release:\n- Alexey Kotlyarov\n- Dino Morelli\n- Jens Petersen\n- Lauren Yim\n- Mike Pilgrem\n- Olivier Benz\n- Simon Hengel\n- Wolfram Kahl","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.9.1","version":0,"site":"https://haskellstack.org/","source":"commercialhaskell","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
