Unlike similar applications, it is not necessary to explicitly tell the application each time you want to minimize to the tray a specific application but it is only necessary to specify the application's filename and then the application will be minimized automatically to the windows tray each time the user minimizes it.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.6","version":0,"site":"https://softpcapps.com/","source":"softpcapps Software","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
