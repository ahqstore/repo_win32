You have a simple goal, to take a CAD file and get your mill to cut it. You don’t want to become an expert on CAM software, you want parts today.\nMeshCAM is made for people who just want to make parts now.\n\nHere’s the MeshCAM process:\n- Load a file from almost any CAD program\n- Build an efficient toolpath with minimal input\n- Save G-code that works on your CNC machine\n\nIf this sounds like you, don’t worry. You can open any image file (JPG, BMP, or PNG) in MeshCAM and the image will be converted to a 3D surface that can be machined directly.\nUsers have come up with incredible uses for this feature to make parts that would be almost impossible with a traditional CAD program.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"9.56","site":"https://www.grzsoftware.com/","source":"GRZ Software LLC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
