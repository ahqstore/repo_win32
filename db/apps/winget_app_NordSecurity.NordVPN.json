Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\n* As quantum computing advances, so do our measures to protect your data. You can now enable post-quantum encryption against the cyber threats of the future. It’s always better to be prepared than to wish you were. Or, as they say: \"Be quantum-proof.\"\n* Being offline won’t turn off auto-connect anymore. It’ll just pause and reconnect you as soon as you’re back online.\n* Colors are slightly different now to make things easier on the eyes.\n* Connection statuses are more consistent across all screens. Because consistency is cool.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.31.8.0","site":"https://nordvpn.com/","source":"Nord Security","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
