Antigravity enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level managing agents across workspaces, while retaining a familiar AI IDE experience at its core. Antigravity extracts agents into their own surface and provides them the tools needed to autonomously operate across the editor, terminal, and browser emphasizing verification and higher-level communication via tasks and artifacts. This capability enables agents to plan and execute more complex, end-to-end software tasks, elevating all aspects of development, from building features, UI iteration, and fixing bugs to research and generating reports.\nAgent Skills\nIntroducing agent skills to Antigravity for enhanced customizability, alongside tab model updates and new conversation settings.\nImprovements (3)\n- Agent Skills now available in Antigravity\n- Updated tab model architecture.\n- New Settings to allow disabling conversation history and knowledge.\nFixes (2)\n- Resolved transparency issues across various UI components.\n- Corrected overactive jump-to-bottom and autoscroll behavior in the chat client.\nPatches (0)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.14.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.google.com/","source":"Google","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
