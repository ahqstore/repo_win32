Antigravity enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level managing agents across workspaces, while retaining a familiar AI IDE experience at its core. Antigravity extracts agents into their own surface and provides them the tools needed to autonomously operate across the editor, terminal, and browser emphasizing verification and higher-level communication via tasks and artifacts. This capability enables agents to plan and execute more complex, end-to-end software tasks, elevating all aspects of development, from building features, UI iteration, and fixing bugs to research and generating reports.\nGoogle One Support\nHigher, more frequently refreshed rate limits for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.\nImprovements (1)\n- Google One integration.\nFixes (0)\n\nPatches (0)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.11.14","version":0,"site":"https://www.google.com/","source":"Google","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
