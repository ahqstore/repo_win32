Adjacent stations are discovered and stored by the LLDP agent for retrieval by a SNMP based network management system.\n\nStarting with version 1.3 the software can optionally read and send CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) packets. Information received in CDP packets is added to the LLDP MIB database of the agent.\n\nThe LLDP agent is implemented as a service for background operation on Windows XP/VISTA/20xx/7/8/10/11 platforms. A Control Panel applet provides interactive access to the service. The LLDP MIB is implemented as SNMP MIB subagent for the Windows SNMP agent.\n\nThe software is shareware.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.4.31.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.hanewin.net/","source":"haneWIN Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
