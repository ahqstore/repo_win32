It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\n- All Platforms\n  - Updated Firefox to 140.7.0esr\n  - Updated NoScript to 13.5.7.1984\n  - Updated Mullvad Browser Extension to 0.9.7\n  - Bug 503: Rebase Mullvad Browser stable onto 140.7.0esr [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 44433: Weird §:domain.com label in the Blocked Objects window [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44474: Backport Security Fixes from Firefox 147 [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44482: (H1) Script execution in Safest mode via data URI navigation [tor-browser]\nBuild System\n- All Platforms\n  - Bug 41682: relprep.py should fail when a GitHub release is not found [tor-browser-build]\n  - Bug 40090: Make the cleanup faster [rbm]\n  - Bug 40095: cached checksums should not be used for input files when refresh_input is enabled [rbm]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.0.4","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
