It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\n- All Platforms\n  - Updated Mullvad Browser Extension to 0.9.6\n  - Bug 486: Possible race condition for upgrade message in about:mullvad-browser [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 488: Remove Leta search engine and migrate users to DuckDuckGo [mullvad-browser]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.0.2","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
