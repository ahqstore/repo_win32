It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\nAll Platforms\n- Updated Firefox to 128.10.0esr\n- Bug 421: Rebase Mullvad Browser release onto 128.10.0esr [mullvad-browser]\n- Bug 43659: Set new tabs to default to Tor Browser Home (about:tor) on desktop [tor-browser]\n- Bug 43672: Incorrect initial letterbox size when the interface font size is 13px.
