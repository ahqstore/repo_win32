It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\n- All Platforms\n  - Updated Firefox to 140.7.1esr\n  - Updated NoScript to 13.5.13.1984\n  - Updated uBlock Origin to 1.69.0\n  - Bug 508: Rebase Mullvad Browser stable onto 140.7.1esr [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 44625: metamask.io won't load on Safer security level [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44626: Propagate WASM blocking to workers [tor-browser]\nBuild System\n- All Platforms\n  - Bug 40338: Running make release multiple times fails [tor-browser-build]\n  - Bug 41708: relprep.py fails to update extensions when out/browser does not exist [tor-browser-build]\n  - Bug 41720: cp -l in release/build fails when crossing file systems [tor-browser-build]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.0.6","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
