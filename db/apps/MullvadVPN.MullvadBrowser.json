It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\nAll Platforms\n- Updated Firefox to 128.9.0esr\n- Updated uBlock Origin to 1.63.2\n- Bug 416: Rebase Mullvad Browser stable onto 128.9.0esr [mullvad-browser]\n- Bug 43601: Backport security fixes from Firefox 137 [tor-browser]\nmacOS + Linux\n- Bug 404: Incorrect information in about:rights [mullvad-browser]\n#Build System\nAll Platforms\n- Bug 41420: Update the changelog script for label updates [tor-browser-build]\nmacOS + Linux\n- Bug 41375: Backport Bug 41374+40799: Remove support for migrate_archs and migrate_langs in update_responses + Remove legacy locale iteration in update-responses and dmg2mar [tor-browser-build]\n- Bug 41378: Backport Bug 41363: Make separate update_responses commit for each platform [tor-browser-build]\n- Bug 41383: Add clairehurst to list of accepted firefox/geckoview signers [tor-browser-build]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"14.0.9","site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
