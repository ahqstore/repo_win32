It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\n- All Platforms\n  - Updated Firefox to 140.5.0esr\n  - Updated NoScript to 13.4\n  - Updated uBlock Origin to 1.67.0\n  - Bug 484: Rebase Mullvad Browser stable onto 140.5.0esr [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 487: Search engines are sorted alphabetically rather than the desired order [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 44275: Reduce console noise on security level guessing [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44310: Default zoom always resets to 100% [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44325: Backport Security Fixes from Firefox 145 [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44333: Add the \"No AI\" version of DuckDuckGo to available search engines [tor-browser]\n- Linux\n  - Bug 44273: Restore Noto CJK as Jigmo has a too low readability [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44315: Font/text issue with self-upgrade window [tor-browser]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.0.1","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
