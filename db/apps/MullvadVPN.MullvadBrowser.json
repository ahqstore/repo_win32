It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\nAll Platforms\n- Updated NoScript to 13.2.1\n- Updated Mullvad Browser Extension to 0.9.5\n- Updated uBlock Origin to 1.66.4\n- Bug 44239: DDG HTML page and search results displayed incorrectly with Safest security setting [tor-browser]\n- Bug 44240: Typo on dom.security.https_first_add_exception_on_failure [tor-browser]\n- Bug 44244: Backport Security Fixes from Firefox 144 [tor-browser]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.5.8","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
