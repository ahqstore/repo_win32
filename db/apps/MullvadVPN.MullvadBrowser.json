It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\n- All Platforms\n  - Updated Firefox to 140.6.0esr\n  - Updated NoScript to 13.5.2.1984\n  - Updated uBlock Origin to 1.68.0\n  - Bug 497: Rebase Mullvad Browser stable onto 140.6.0esr [mullvad-browser]\n  - Bug 22974: Self-host NoScript Updates [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44348: Backport Bugzilla 1999126: Protect whether PDF.js is enabled/disabled to improve fingerprinting protection [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44391: Restrictions cascade blocks every capability in subframes (e.g. captchas) [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44409: Backport Security Fixes from Firefox 146 [tor-browser]\n  - Bug 44414: Disable Zucchini for the 15.0 series.
