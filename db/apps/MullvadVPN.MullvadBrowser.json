It's produced to minimize tracking and fingerprinting.\n\nWhen you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. That’s why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser – a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.\nAll Platforms\n- Updated uBlock Origin to 1.66.0\n- Bug 44199: Backport Security Fixes from Firefox 143 [tor-browser]\n- Bug 41462: Backport #40994 and #41280: Add support in signing scripts to sign release for some archs only & Update download-android-*.json files for android-only releases [tor-browser-build]\n- Bug 41543: mmdebstrap-image fails to build bookworm images on maint-14.5 [tor-browser-build]\nBuild System\nLinux\n- Bug 41560: Backport mullvad-browser#463: Fix typo in MimeType entry in .desktop file included in deb/rpm package [tor-browser-build]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.5.7","version":0,"site":"https://mullvad.net/","source":"Mullvad VPN","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
