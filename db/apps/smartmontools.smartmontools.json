It is derived from smartsuite.\n\nThe smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks.\nIn many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning of disk degradation and failure.\nSmartmontools was originally derived from the Linux â€‹smartsuite package and actually supports ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks and also SCSI/SAS tape devices.\nIt should run on any modern Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin (macOS), Solaris, Windows, Cygwin, OS/2, eComStation or QNX system.\nSmartmontools can also be run from one of many different Live CDs/DVDs.\n- CI and release builds are now reproducible if same SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH,\n  build recipes and toolchains are used.\n- smartctl -j -A: New JSON value 'endurance_used' (ATA/SCSI/NVMe).\n- smartctl -j -A: New JSON value 'spare_available' (ATA/NVMe).\n- smartctl -j -i: Re-added the JSON value 'model_name' also for SCSI\n  devices (regression).\n- smartctl -j -c: NVMe support.\n- smartctl -j -n ...: New JSON values 'power_mode.*' (ATA only).\n- smartctl -H -A: Support for NVMe SMART/Health Information per\n  namespace.\n- smartctl -i: ATA ACS-6 updates.\n- smartctl -x: No longer includes -g wcreorder.\n- smartctl -x, -l scterc: No longer returns exit status 4 if SCT ERC\n  is not supported by the device.\n- smartctl -l error: No longer prints bogus ATA error log entries if\n  the error index is nonzero but the error count is zero.\n- smartctl -l ssd: Fixed corruption of the output of the SCSI Format\n  Status log page.\n- smartctl -l ssd: Now detects 'no format since manufacture' from the\n  SCSI Format Status log page.\n- smartctl -l farm: Fixed the unit of 'Write Power On' time.\n- smartctl -l farm: Fixed the byte order of ATA 'Assembly Date'.\n- smartctl -l farm: Fixed a possible segfault.\n- smartctl -l farm -q noserial: Suppresses serial and WWN also from FARM.\n- smartctl -l farm -T permissive: Overrides false negative FARM support\n  check for rebranded drives.\n- smartctl -t TEST: Fixed self-tests of single namespace NVMe devices.\n- smartd -A: NVMe attribute log support.\n- smartd: Ignores NSID in duplicate check of single namespace devices.\n- smartd: No longer issues LOG_CRIT warnings for 'Set Feature' related\n  NVMe error information log entries.\n- smartd: No longer hangs on systems with large file descriptor limits.\n- smartd: No longer logs invalid \"old test ... not run\" messages if\n  staggered self-tests are used.\n- smartd.conf -l selftest[sts] -s ...: NVMe self-test support.\n- smartd.conf -H MASK: Ability to ignore specific bits of NVMe\n  SMART/Health value 'Critical Warning'.\n- smartd.conf -p: Checks NVMe SMART/Health value 'Available Spare'.\n- smartd.conf -u [-f]: Checks NVMe SMART/Health values 'Percentage Used'\n  and 'Media and Data Integrity Errors'.\n- smartd.conf -W ...: No longer includes individual sensors in NVMe\n  temperature check as some devices report other values there.\n- ATA: Device type -d jmb39x-q2,N for another JMB39x protocol variant\n  used by QNAP-TR002 NAS devices.\n- SCSI: Fixed range checks of mode page offset and VPD inquiry.\n- SCSI: Fixed buffer overflow parsing of VPD page.\n- SCSI: Fixed handling of multiple designators in VPD page.\n- USB/NVMe: -d sntjmicron no longer triggers USB resets on queries of\n  the self-test log.\n- USB/NVMe: -d sntasmedia now supports log pages > 512 bytes.\n- USB/NVMe/SAT: New experimental NVMe/SAT autodetection options\n  -d snt*/sat.\n- Fixed segfault on missing option argument on systems using musl libc.\n- HDD, SSD and USB additions to drive database.\n- automake < 1.13 are no longer supported.\n- Custom make rules are now silenced if make V=0 is used.\n- Enhanced makefile targets dist-* to create reproducible source\n  tarballs if SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set.\n- The makefile no longer uses GNU make specific syntax elements\n  (exception: reproducible builds for macOS).\n- Dropped support for platforms without sigaction().\n- configure: Now also detects MidnightBSD.\n- configure: Dropped option --with-signal-func.\n- configure: Default for --with-nvme-devicescan is now 'yes' also on\n  NetBSD.\n- Version information is now also set if build from GH R/O mirror.\n- Linux: smartd.service now avoids a warning about an unset environment\n  variable.\n- Linux: Dropped autodetection of deprecated device type -d marvell.\n- macOS: Support for reproducible builds of the DMG image.\n- OpenBSD: NVMe support.\n- Windows: Increased WMI timeout.\n- Windows: Support for reproducible builds of the installer.\n- Windows: Uninstaller is no longer damaged if the installer is signed.\n- Windows update-smartd-drivedb.ps1: Fixed call of gpg.exe if it\n  appears more than once in the PATH.\n- Windows update-smartd-drivedb.ps1 -Verbose: Now also prints the\n  download command.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.5","version":0,"site":"https://www.smartmontools.org/","source":"smartmontools.org","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
