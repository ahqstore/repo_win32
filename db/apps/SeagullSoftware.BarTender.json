This fix affects Designer, Integration Builder, and Process Builder.\n- Print Preview for the Dual_Column.btw template displays the Data Entry Form with the fields and field names lined up correctly.\n- The time needed to open a file or change (redirect) a printer is now significantly less than in previous versions of BarTender.\n- BarTender no longer slows down or delays printing when using Integration Builder to automate printing with a large number of printers are installed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"11.5.1","site":"https://www.seagullsoftware.com/","source":"Seagull Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
