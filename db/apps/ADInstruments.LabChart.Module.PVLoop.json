The module calculates and displays a wide range of cardiac function parameters, relationships and plots. The module can be used to analyze pre-recorded data or to analyze data as it is sampled.\n2.6\n- Three new workflows have been added to PV Loop that support the MPVS Duo device. These new workflows are:\n  - MPVS Duo - Admittance\n  - MPVS Duo - Small Mammal Conductance\n  - MPVS Duo - Large Mammal Conductance\n- The MPVS Duo workflows are streamlined using catheter selection and selectable segment lengths for known catheters.\n- The existing Small Mammal and Large Mammal workflows have been renamed to reflect that they relate to the MPVS Ultra hardware device. The new names for these existing workflows are:\n  - MPVS Ultra - Small Mammal\n  - MPVS Ultra - Large Mammal","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.6.0400","version":0,"site":null,"source":"ADInstruments","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
