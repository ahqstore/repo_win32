Think of it like a distributed real-time Wireshark with a lot more analytics features.\nThe Packetbeat shippers sniff the traffic between your application processes, parse on the fly protocols like HTTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis or Thrift and correlate the messages into transactions.\nFor each transaction, the shipper inserts a JSON document into Elasticsearch, where it is stored and indexed. You can then use Kibana to view key metrics and do ad-hoc queries against the data.\nFeatures and enhancements\nAll\n- Make beats receivers emit status for their subcomponents. #48015\n- Add GUID translation, base DN inference, and SSPI authentication to LDAP processor. #47827\nFilebeat\n- Log unpublished event count and exit publish loop on input context cancellation. #47730 #47717\n- Improving input error reporting to Elastic Agent, specially when pipeline configurations are incorrect. #47905 #45649\nMetricbeat\n- K8s_container_allocatable. #47815 #40701\n  Updates kubernetes cpu and memory metrics to use allocatable values instead of capacity values.\n- Add resource pool id to vsphere cluster metricset. #47883\nPacketbeat\n- Ipfrag2. #47970\nFixes\nFilebeat\n- Prevent panic during startup if dissect processor has invalid field name in tokenizer. #47839\nMetricbeat\n- Improve defensive checks to prevent panics in meraki module. #47950\n- Remove GCP Billing timestamp functions. #47963 #47967\nPacketbeat\n- Rpc_fragment_sanitization. #47803\n- Verify and cap memcache udp fragment counts. #47874","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.2.3","version":0,"site":"https://www.elastic.co/","source":"Elastic","license_or_tos":"Elastic-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
