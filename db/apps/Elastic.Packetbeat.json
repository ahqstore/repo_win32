Think of it like a distributed real-time Wireshark with a lot more analytics features.\nThe Packetbeat shippers sniff the traffic between your application processes, parse on the fly protocols like HTTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis or Thrift and correlate the messages into transactions.\nFor each transaction, the shipper inserts a JSON document into Elasticsearch, where it is stored and indexed. You can then use Kibana to view key metrics and do ad-hoc queries against the data.\nFeatures and enhancements\nFilebeat\n- Add data stream identification to Fleet health status updates. #47229\nMetricbeat\n- Enhance GCP Billing metricset with additional fields. #47059\nFixes\nAll\n- Add close to conditional processors if underlying processors have a close method. #46653 #46575\n- Fix a bug where Kerberos authentication could be disabled when server supports multiple authentication types. #47444 #47443 #47110\nFilebeat\n- Fix potential Filebeat panic during memory queue shutdown. #47248","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.2.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.elastic.co/","source":"Elastic","license_or_tos":"Elastic-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
