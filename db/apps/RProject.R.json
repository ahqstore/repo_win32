It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.\nR provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.\nOne of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.\nR is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.\nNEW FEATURES\n- The internal method of unzip() now follows unzip 6.00 in how it handles extracted file paths which contain \"../\". With thanks to Ivan Krylov.\nINSTALLATION\n- Standalone nmath can be built with early-2025 versions of clang-based compilers such as LLVM clang 20, Apple clang 17 and Intel icx 2025.0.\n- Tcl/Tk 9 can be used to build package tcltk: this has become the default in some Linux distributions. N.B. several third-party packages currently require Tcl/Tk 8 or even 8.6 without declaring so.\nBUG FIXES\n- Java detection in javareconf could not detect ‘libjvm.*’ in the zero variant of the JDK (PR#18884). All valid variants as of JDK 24u are now supported.\n- factanal(.., rotation=*) now correctly updates rotmat, fixing PR#18886.\n- dnbinom(<large>, <muchlarger>, ..) now is 0 correctly, instead of NaN or Inf sometimes.\n- dbinom(<large>, n=Inf, ..) is 0 now correctly, instead of NaN which also fixes many dnbinom() cases, notably those mentioned in PR#16727 comment #5.\n- Fixing C level “binomial deviance” bd0() for extreme arguments (preventing under-/overflow) solves more PR#16727 cases and also prevents some full accuracy loss in such cases for dbinom(), dnbinom(), and via dbinom_raw() potentially dgeom(), dhyper(), dbeta(), and df().\n- signif(1.**e308, digits) no longer truncates unnecessarily (but still to prevent overflow to Inf), fixing PR#18889.\n- prettyNum(*, zero.print={>=1-char}, replace.zero=TRUE) now works as documented, thanks to Marttila Mikko and Ivan Krylov's messages on R-devel.\n- pbeta(x, a,b, ..) for very large a,b no longer returns NaN but the correct values (0 or 1, or their logs for log.p = TRUE). This improves Mathlib's C level bratio() and hence also pnbinom(), etc..","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.5.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.r-project.org","source":"R Core Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
