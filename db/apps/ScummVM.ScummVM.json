The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed! ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games' executables and is not an emulator. It supports a huge library of adventures with over 325 games in total. It supports many classics published by legendary studios like LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and Westwood Studios. Next to ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series, Broken Sword, Myst, Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some really obscure adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.9.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.scummvm.org/","source":"The ScummVM Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
