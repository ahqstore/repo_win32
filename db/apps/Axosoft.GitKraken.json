Our new architecture requires rebuilding theme support from the ground up. Light, dark, and high-contrast themes will remain available during the transition.\n  - We plan to restore custom theme support once the modernization is complete.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"11.8.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.axosoft.com/","source":"GitKraken","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
