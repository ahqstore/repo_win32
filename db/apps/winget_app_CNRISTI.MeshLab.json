It is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind of meshes.\nMeshLab is mostly based on the open source C++ mesh processing library VCGlib developed at the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI - CNR. VCG can be used as a stand-alone large-scale automated mesh processing pipeline, while MeshLab makes it easy to experiment with its algorithms interactively.\nMeshLab is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2023.12","site":"https://www.meshlab.net/","source":"Paolo Cignoni - VCG - ISTI - CNR","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
