We encourage users to install a 64-bit version of Firefox.\n- Horizontal tabs are now slightly more round, following the look of vertical tabs. Buttons and text inputs, including the Address bar, have been updated as well for consistency.\nDeveloper\n\nWeb Platform\n- Support has been added for the Atomics.waitAsync proposal, which is a non-blocking, asynchronous version of Atomics.wait. This allow synchronization of threads based upon the value in a shared memory location, for more details please consult our MDN documentation.\n- We now support the legacy -webkit-fill-available keyword as a value for the CSS width and height properties, to improve rendering of content on the web that uses this keyword. This keyword is an alias for the recently standardized stretch keyword (which isn't shipping in Firefox yet).\n- Firefox now partially supports the new Integrity-Policy header, which is used to enforce sub-resource integrity for scripts.\n- Added Matroska support for the most commonly used codecs: AVC, HEVC, VP8, VP9, AV1, AAC, Opus, and Vorbis.\n- The text-autospace property is now supported, allowing automatic spacing adjustments between characters from different scripts.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"145.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.mozilla.org/","source":"Mozilla","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
