The program works with MSSQL databases created on Windows (NTFS or ReFS) and on Linux (Ext2/3/4).\n\nThis SQL database repair tool works like no other because it is unique in its capabilities. Here are its main advantages:\n- It restores .mdf files.\n- It has two MSSQL recovery modes:\n  * “Repair existing database” mode: when database files cannot be opened, MSSQL Recovery works around inaccessible or damaged files and boosts your chances for recovering the rest of the tables.\n  * “Recover database from disk” mode: deleted databases can be restored with MSSQL Recovery.\n- You can preview the restored files before export.\n- The trial version is completely free and lets you use all functions of the paid version, except export.\n- You can export to MSSQL via ADO/ODBC protocols.\n- It supports SQL Server 2008-2019 encrypted databases.\n- It supports all national and Unicode character tables.\n- It supports databases created with:\n  * MS SQL Server 2019 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2017 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2016 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2014 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2012 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2008 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2005 (x86, x64, Express)\n  * MS SQL Server 2000 (x86, x64)\n- It supports page compression and row compression.\n- MSSQL Recovery support file system as ReFS, UFS, exFAT, NTFS, FAT, HFS, Ext2/3/4, RomFS(reader), ReiserFS, XFS, Reiser4.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.15","version":0,"site":"https://www.diskinternals.com/","source":"DiskInternals Research","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
