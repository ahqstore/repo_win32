It’s also capable of restoring corrupted files and can read and recover the information located on an inaccessible drive. The files you restore can be saved on any (including network) disk, which is visible to the host operating system.\n\nThe utility also allows you to repair a corrupt or damaged partition table and attempt to restore a disk after a serious crash, so you’ll have a chance to repair a serious malfunction right away.\n\nIn case you noticed that you lost a piece of valuable information only after you formatted a partition, DiskInternals Linux Recovery can unformat the disk and it’ll be up and running again.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.24.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.diskinternals.com/","source":"DiskInternals Research","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
