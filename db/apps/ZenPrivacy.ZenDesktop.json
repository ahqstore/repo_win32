Thanks to @kasyap1234 for the contribution!\n- NSS trust store\n  The app now also installs the CA certificate into the NSS trust store. This notably improves the experience on Firefox – you're now less likely to encounter certificate errors on first launch. Thanks @donnykd for implementing this!\n- More reliable proxy on macOS\n  We've improved how the system proxy is configured on macOS, ensuring filtering remains active across all network interfaces. This also improves compatibility with various VPNs.\n- Other minor improvements and bug fixes.\nThank you for using Zen!\nFull Changelog: v0.15.4...v0.16.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.16.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/ZenPrivacy","source":"Zen Privacy","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
