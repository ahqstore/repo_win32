However, Joystick Gremlin works with any device be it from different manufacturers or custom devices that appear as a joystick to Windows. Joystick Gremlin uses the virtual joysticks provided by vJoy to map physical to virtual inputs and apply various other transformations such as response curves to analogue axes. In addition to customizing joysticks, Joystick Gremlin also provides powerful macro functionalities, a flexible mode system, scripting using Python, and many other features.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"13.1.0","site":"http://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin","source":"H2IK","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public License v3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
