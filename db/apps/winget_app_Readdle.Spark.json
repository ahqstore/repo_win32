Focused. Email.\n\nFast, cross-platform email designed to filter out the noise - so you can focus on what's important.\nThis update includes:\n- Improved calendar sync on desktop: Spark now properly syncs actions from the web version of the calendar, ensuring a smoother experience across devices.\n- Better composer shortcuts: Fixed an issue where actions and shortcuts wouldn’t work if the composer wasn’t in focus. Now, shortcuts like Send work seamlessly without requiring extra clicks to refocus.\n- Fixed UI issues: Resolved flickering in Split View and fixed an issue where To/CC/BCC fields were reset when applying an email template.\n- Shared Inbox & navigation fixes: \"Assigned to me\" emails now appear in the Unified Inbox, and closing the calendar returns you to the correct email account.\n- Additional bug fixes and improvements: Various optimizations, including correct username updates for team accounts and eliminating endless loading when assigning emails.\nThank you for using Spark!
