Focused. Email.\n\nFast, cross-platform email designed to filter out the noise - so you can focus on what's important.\nThis update brings stability improvements and bug fixes:\n- Fixed an issue preventing logins for non-Gmail accounts. Spark incorrectly displayed the Gmail login page instead of the correct login pages for other providers.\n- Fixed an issue causing the Calendar tab to close unexpectedly in certain scenarios, redirecting users to the Inbox.\n- Improved template sorting in search resultsâ€”teams with matching templates now appear first, making it easier to find the right one.\nThis release also includes UI adjustments, refinements for right-to-left (RTL) text display, style enhancements, and general performance optimizations.\n\nFor any questions or issues, feel free to contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.20.5","site":"https://readdle.com/","source":"Spark Mail Limited","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
