Please backup your saves, especially when updating Wav2Bar.\nNote for Linux\nRight now Linux is not very well supported, but I try my best to make it better bit by bit. For now you should be able to use Wav2Bar without much problem by using the zipped version or using the source code after installing the dependencies (see the README or the wiki). There are some predefined (but not tested) configs to make some other linux packages that you can try.\nNote for Mac\nMac is not supported at this moment, but you can give it a try using the source code (see the README or the wiki).\nSupport\nFor bug reports, please use the issues section of GitHub.
