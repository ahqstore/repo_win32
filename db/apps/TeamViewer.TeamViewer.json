This means you can return to the same group instantly without reopening it, making it easier to continue where you left off.\n- Devices can now be easily moved between groups in the Advanced view using drag-and-drop.\n\nImprovements\n- Share devices and device groups: Its now easier than ever to share devices and device groups. Select individual users or user groups and assign permissions directly in a new but familiar workflow. Share replaces the previous add and remove manager options, offering a simpler, streamlined way to manage access.\n- A banner is now shown on the Permissions tab of a device to indicate when inheritance is disabled, along with a button to turn it back on.\n\nBugfixes\n- Minor fixes and improvements.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.75.4","version":0,"site":"https://www.teamviewer.com/","source":"TeamViewer","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
