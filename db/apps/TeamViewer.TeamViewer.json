This streamlines setup and improves reliability.\n- The Recent Connections list on the Remote Support page in TeamViewer Remote now mirrors the classic client experience. Devices can also be bookmarked directly from the list, just as in the classic version.\n- The Permissions tab in the device details drawer has been redesigned for easier visibility of managers and their assigned permissions. You can now also see the source of each permission—whether it's directly assigned to a manager or inherited from a group.\n\nImprovements\n- A minor bugfix has been implemented to reduce load during client startup.\n- CoPilot has been renamed to Tia (TeamViewer intelligent agent). Tia will deliver agentic capabilities across TeamViewer products and use cases.\n- The TeamViewer Remote native client now offers improved performance by optimizing how devices are stored on the UI side. This results in faster loading times and a smoother user experience.\n- Devices are now fetched more quickly, enabling faster access to device information and improving overall efficiency.\n\nBugfixes\n- Fixed a bug affecting the permissions inheritance feature on managed devices.\n- Fixed a bug that prevented devices from appearing under Company Devices in Admin Settings.\n- Fixed a bug that could cause the in-session toolbar to disappear, particularly when dragged to the far-right corner in full-screen mode.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"15.72.3","version":0,"site":"https://www.teamviewer.com/","source":"TeamViewer","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
