Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\n* We reorganized our dashboard to make navigation easier. The map tab is now smoothly integrated into the dashboard, alongside the other features — Threat Protection and Dark Web Monitor. Fewer tabs, fewer clicks.\n* Threat Protection Pro™ got extra armor. The crypto wallet address checker has landed under the advanced browsing protection category. Turn it on, and we’ll flag unsafe wallet addresses you may come across while browsing. After all, we’d prefer you don’t accidentally fund a scammer.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.48.3.0","site":null,"source":"Nord Security","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
