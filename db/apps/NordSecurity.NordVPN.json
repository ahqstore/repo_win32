Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\nThreat Protection Pro™ has a new tool to keep you safer online:\n* “Hijacked session alert” will let you know if your website login cookies show up in a stolen sessions database. It’s already on if your plan includes Threat Protection Pro™, keeping unwelcome guests out of your accounts.\nVPN picked up a couple of handy updates:\n* The “Pause” button got more time options — 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes, or even 24 hours. Short break, long break, we’ve got all options covered.\n* “Quick Connect” is now called “Secure my connection.” It’s the same one-click path to the best server, minus the name that may have left you wondering if “Slow Connect” was hiding somewhere.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.49.5.0","site":null,"source":"Nord Security","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
