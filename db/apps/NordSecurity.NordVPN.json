Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\n* The app will from now on try (and try again if need be) to restore your VPN connection if it ever drops for any reason. In doing so, it’ll keep leak protection active so your data stays safe even mid-connection.\n* Our “Products” tab is growing up fast. The new “Your security suite” section shows what’s already protecting you — and what still needs a quick setup or just a click to turn it on. We’re not saying you should turn everything on… just that your security looks really good when you do.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.53.3.0","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Nord Security","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
