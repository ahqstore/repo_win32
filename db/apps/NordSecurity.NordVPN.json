Enjoy more secure streaming, browsing, and work with NordVPN.\n\nNordVPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP and physical location. Works on 6 devices at once, on every major platform. With NordVPN, encrypt your online activity to protect your private data from hackers or snoopy advertisers. Enjoy global connectivity along with high-performance speed and secure access to streaming websites, censored content and social networks.\n* You asked, we listened. You can now set your preferred location for the “Secure my connection” button. The default is “Fastest server” but you can change this setting to any country or server group instead. Once you do, the app will stick to that choice every time you click the button.\n* Meet our brand-new AI-assisted recommendations for the fastest connection. Instead of relying on distance only, the smart selection considers several factors to pick the best server for your network conditions. Just choose “Fastest server” in the preferred location settings, and we’ll take it from there.\n* Adventure is great, but clicking mystery links in your email? That’s a plot twist no one needs. The new email protection feature in Threat Protection Pro™ now scans URLs in your browser’s Gmail and Yahoo inboxes and flags the unsafe ones. To learn what the threat is, just hover over the warning icon that appears next to a link.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.54.8.0","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Nord Security","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
