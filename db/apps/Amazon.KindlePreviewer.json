Use Kindle Previewer, a free desktop standalone application, as you format your book so you can make sure it looks as intended. Kindle Previewer also shows you how your book will look with the latest typographic and layout improvements that come with Enhanced Typesetting.\nIf you're planning on publishing your eBook on KDP, you can also use our Online Previewer to make sure your book meets your expectations before you publish. The Online Previewer has the same basic functions (preview by device type, orientation, and font size) as the desktop version but has a different look and fewer filter and display options.\nIncludes stability improvements and bug fixes.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.100.0","version":0,"site":"https://kdp.amazon.com/","source":"Amazon","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
