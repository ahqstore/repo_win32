It handles jetbrains:// links by intercepting URL requests and forwarding them to the Toolbox App, providing a more reliable experience when opening links from browsers, documentation, or external applications.\nPlugin Updates Without Restart\nPlugins can now be updated without restarting the application, as the Toolbox App will pick up plugin changes automatically.
