Previously, the SQL provider close path didn’t\n  close the underlying *doltdb.DoltDB for newly created DBs in nocache mode, leaving the journal manifest LOCK held and\n  causing retries / reopens to fail.\n- 10374: cache strictLookupIter\n- 10371: go.mod,.github: Bump Go version to 1.25.6.\n  Fixes potential impact in some configurations from CVE-2025-61729.\n- 10366: Bug fix: don't set branch control admin privs when rebasing\n  Fixes #10352\n- 10363: Add embedded-mode options to bypass DB cache and fail fast on journal lock contention\n  This PR adds opt-in controls for embedded/driver use-cases that need deterministic reopen semantics under contention:\n  • Disable local singleton DB caching for file-backed databases via a new dbfactory param, so each open constructs a fresh store.\n  • Fail fast on journal manifest lock timeout via a new dbfactory param, returning a sentinel error instead of falling back to read-only.\n  • Plumb DB load parameters through the SQL engine / env so an embedded driver can thread these options into Dolt database creation.\n  Key changes\n  • dbfactory:\n  • Adds DisableSingletonCacheParam (disable_singleton_cache)\n  • Adds FailOnJournalLockTimeoutParam (fail_on_journal_lock_timeout)\n  • Bypasses the singleton cache in FileFactory.CreateDB when disable_singleton_cache is set.\n  • nbs:\n  • Adds ErrDatabaseLocked\n  • Adds JournalingStoreOptions + NewLocalJournalingStoreWithOptions\n  • Updates newJournalManifest(..., failOnTimeout) to return ErrDatabaseLocked on lock timeout when enabled.\n  • SQL engine / env plumbing:\n  • Adds DBLoadParams to engine.SqlEngineConfig and threads them into env.DoltEnv prior to DB loading.\n  • Adds DBLoadParams to env.DoltEnv and merges them into both DB load paths (LoadDoltDB and LoadDoltDBWithParams).\n  • Updates env.MultiEnvForDirectory to respect a caller-provided *DoltEnv to avoid preloading before params are set.\n- 10314: Minimize binlog deletions in branch control\n  I didn't find a way to trigger multiple deletions through SQL on non-existent rows, but just in case we're somehow able to get to that point through some other bug, we put it in the binlog everytime. This way, we only add to the binlog if we actually had something to delete.\n- 9748: Bump gopkg.in/yaml.v3 from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 in /integration-tests/transactions\n  Bumps gopkg.in/yaml.v3 from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1.\n  Dependabot compatibility score\n  You can trigger a rebase of this PR by commenting @dependabot rebase.\n  [//]: # (dependabot-automerge-start)\n  [//]: # (dependabot-automerge-end)\n  Dependabot commands and options\n  You can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR: - `@dependabot rebase` will rebase this PR - `@dependabot recreate` will recreate this PR, overwriting any edits that have been made to it - `@dependabot merge` will merge this PR after your CI passes on it - `@dependabot squash and merge` will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it - `@dependabot cancel merge` will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging - `@dependabot reopen` will reopen this PR if it is closed - `@dependabot close` will close this PR and stop Dependabot recreating it.

Ideally, we want to push filters to directly above the data source that they reference.\n  Previously, we only pushed filters if they only referenced a single table, since pushing a filter that referenced multiple tables could potentially move the filter to a location where one of the referenced tables is no longer in scope. However, if the extra table references refer to a table in an outer scope or lateral scope, pushing the filter is completely safe. GetFields that reference an outer or lateral scope can be effectively treated as literals for the purpose of this optimization.\n  This PR changes getFiltersByTable, a function that maps tables onto the filters that reference those tables. Previously it would ignore filters that reference multiple tables. Now, it allows those filters provided that the extra references are to outer/lateral scopes.\n  This improves many of the plan tests:\n  - The changed test in tpch_plans.go pushes a filter into the leftmost table lookup\n  - The second changed test in query_plans.go replaces a naive InnerJoin with a CrossHashjoin","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.81.3","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/dolthub/dolt","source":"DoltHub","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
