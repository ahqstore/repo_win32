Documentation and support are not available. We recommend testing the preview version before using it for production work.\n1.85.0\nNew Capabilities\n- Added a new dialog to select both the organization and license type after logging in\n- Custom ASPRS classes can now have their id set manually\n- The orthomosaic generation now respects the region of interest (ROI), allowing the orthomosaic area to be restricted without regenerating the DSM\n- Added an “Ortho mode” button to the section view toolbar to easily toggle 90-degree angle vectorization\n- Added Ukrainian as an available language\nAdditional Updates and Improvements\n- Split processing options in the processing panel, moving advanced settings under a new \"More options\" button\n- Updated the processing option logic in the PIX4Dcloud \"Process\" tab:\n  - The \"PIX4Dcatch\" option is now disabled for drone-only projects\n  - Mixed (drone + PIX4Dcatch) projects now default to \"Nadir\" and display a warning, as this combination is not officially supported. The \"Oblique\" and \"PIX4Dcatch\" options remain enabled\n- Added a validation to block project uploads to PIX4Dcloud if the horizontal and vertical CRS units do not match\n- Improved the mesh generation to avoid gaps between adjacent tiles\n- Improved the mesh generation for merged projects to better handle varying point cloud densities\n- Made several improvements to the orthomosaic editor:\n  - The visibility of patch borders can now be controlled independently from the patch content\n  - Patches are now always rendered as flat horizontal polygons in the image viewer\n- Added an option to export the orthomosaic without transparency to improve compatibility with third-party software\n- Updated the drag-and-drop behavior for folders: project files (e.g., .opf) are now detected and opened directly, which also allows for opening multiple projects in one operation\n- Improved camera support:\n  - Added more robust focal length reading from EXIF data\n  - Included support for Skydio-specific GPS accuracy\n  - Refined minimum GPS accuracy for DJI cameras\n- Updated project calibration behavior to properly integrate GCPs for georeferencing when input DJI RTK imagery is tagged with too-high geotag accuracies\n- Added new menu options to the ASPRS class panel to toggle class visibility, switch between RGB/monochrome view, and remove classification\n- Polygon vertex tie-points are now rendered in the 2D view\n- The quality report now correctly displays the DSM interpolation strategy\n- Added support for two new geoid models:\n  - Norway/Svalbard: Svalbard_EGG2015_2024\n  - Netherlands/Bonaire: BONGEO2004\n- Changed the \"Add keyframe\" shortcut to Ctrl+K\n- Updated the user account menu: \"Organizations\" is now \"Organizations & licenses\", \"Licenses\" is now \"Plan and licenses\", and icons were added for external links\n- Improved the error message when trying to re-upload to a project with a different CRS\nBug fixes\n- Fixed a crash that could occur when exporting an orthomosaic with large empty regions into multiple tiles\n- Fixed an issue where DSM generation could get stuck or crash when using the “Expand area” option if all point cloud points were above the cameras\n- Fixed an issue that prevented users from entering certain characters in the custom report input fields\n- Fixed an issue where the sky background would flicker in orthographic mode\n- Fixed several issues related to mesh generation:\n  - Corrected an issue that could cause the surface to be trimmed too aggressively in datasets with very different point cloud densities\n  - Addressed a rare issue where the mesh generation algorithm could spend considerable time estimating the point cloud density\n  - Resolved an issue that caused long processing times during mesh generation for non-axis-aligned corridor projects","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.86.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.pix4d.com/","source":"https://www.pix4d.com/","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
