This does no harm.\n- Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.\nNEW: Docker Buildx is now required for Docker Compose\n> Error: Docker Compose is configured to build using Bake, but buildx isn't installed\nDocker Compose changed its default builder to Bake in v2.37.0.\nDDEV v1.24.7 and below used the legacy builder, but v1.24.8 has switched to the new Bake builder, which requires Docker Buildx to be installed.\nSolution: Ensure Docker Buildx is installed on your system. Most modern Docker installations include Buildx by default, but if you encounter this error, you may need to update Docker or manually install the Buildx plugin.\nHighlights\n- Experimental support for add-ons written primarily in PHP\n- ddev add-on get can now automatically download add-on dependencies\n- ddev add-on get <your **PRIVATE** GitHub repo>: Support for DDEV_GITHUB_TOKEN as a bearer token for GitHub downloads and private GitHub add-ons\n- Parallel Docker image pulls for faster performance, thanks to @glensc for the idea\n- Improved Pantheon provider support, .ddev/providers/pantheon.yaml provided by default\n- Upsun support for multiple apps and multiple databases\n- https://docs.ddev.com/ is now the canonical documentation source (replaces https://ddev.readthedocs.io/)\n- Dynamic DDEV project sponsorship information if provided once a day on ddev start.\nFeatures\n- ddev debug download-images --all now pulls all images for all projects\n- ddev heidisql now works on Linux, thanks to @punkrock34\n- Support for alternative GitHub token environment variables: DDEV_GITHUB_TOKEN (highest priority), GH_TOKEN (lower priority than DDEV_GITHUB_TOKEN), GITHUB_TOKEN (lowest priority)\n- New ddev npx global command, thanks to @dragonwize\n- host.docker.internal now available in all containers, not just web\n- Pantheon provider now always pulls current upstream database (instead of a backup) and uses the Terminus rsync plugin for file push, thanks to @danny2p\n- Traefik healthcheck extended to validate file routers and detect config errors\n- Improved support for ddev config global --no-bind-mounts with automated testing\n- Manual testing with macOS 26 Tahoe (beta) shows no obvious problems;
