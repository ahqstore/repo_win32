This does no harm.\n- Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.\nHighlights:\n- Sponsored by the TYPO3 Community: Integrate XHGui into DDEV, enable it with ddev poweroff && ddev config global --xhprof-mode=xhgui, then use ddev xhgui in any of your projects.\n- DevDb VS Code extension: First class support for DDEV, thanks to @damms005\nFeatures:\n- Optional Docker Compose profiles: You can now start projects with specific profiles using ddev start --profiles=list,of,profiles\n- Backdrop: a new quickstart based on the official add-on, thanks to @laryn\n- New MutagenSync annotation: Custom commands that alter the host system can now use this annotation to help synchronize changes.\nBug Fixes:\n- DDEV router now works properly behind proxies (regression from v1.24.0).\n- Show router URLs in ddev describe and ddev list when default 80/443 port is busy (regression from v1.24.3).\n- Correct status color formatting in ddev describe and ddev list.\n- Remove outdated Traefik images with ddev delete images, thanks to @rpkoller\n- Resolve misleading errors in ddev debug test when run outside the project root.\n- Fix invalid upload_dirs on traditional Windows setups.\n- Sanitize ~/.ddev/project_list.yaml to prevent panic.\n- Make the DDEV_PAGER environment variable optional to prevent it from breaking wp-cli output.\n- Prevent overwriting the generic project type when running ddev config --update.\n- Update DATABASE_URL to use charset=utf8mb4 in MySQL and MariaDB for Symfony projects, thanks to @RubenColpaert\n- Delete third-party built images on ddev delete.\nMinor Updates:\n- PHP 8.3.19 and 8.4.5\n- Fix displaying for #ddev-description stanza in add-on install actions, thanks to @hanoii\n- Show custom config.*.yaml on ddev start,
