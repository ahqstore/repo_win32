This does no harm.\n- Consider ddev config --auto to update your projects to current configuration.\nHighlights\n- Support for PHP 8.5.0 RC 3 (note: some extensions are not yet available: apcu, imagick, memcached, redis, uploadprogress, xdebug, xhprof, xmlrpc, yaml)\n- Support for PostgreSQL 18\n- Automatic HTTP/S communication between DDEV projects - no need to manually configure external_links\n- Option to omit project names in .ddev/config.yaml by default with ddev config global --omit-project-name-by-default=true - useful when working with multiple Git worktrees\n- Auto-discovery of PLATFORM_PROJECT and PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT from existing config for Upsun Flex and Upsun Fixed (Platform.sh) provider integrations\nFeatures\n- New ddev utility diagnose command for quick diagnostics on your DDEV installation and current project\n- New ddev add-on search command, thanks to @AkibaAT\n- New ddev xdebug info command to display xdebug_info() output\n- Customize ddev describe output using the x-ddev.describe-* extensions - useful for add-ons\n- Change ddev ssh shell using the x-ddev.ssh-shell extension - useful for add-ons\n- New --user/-u flag for ddev exec and ddev ssh\n- exec hooks now support the user field\n- New pre-share and post-share hooks. This can help change the required URL for ddev share in CMSs like WordPress and Magento2.\n- PostgreSQL connection support in ddev heidisql, thanks to @raphaelportmann\n- Show failed container logs on project start by running DDEV_DEBUG=true ddev start\n- Enhanced composer_root support for app type detection in CakePHP, Craft CMS, Laravel, Magento 2, Shopware 6, and Symfony, thanks to @vanWittlaer for initial PR for Shopware 6\n- Silence warnings about custom configuration files in the .ddev directory by adding #ddev-silent-no-warn to the file. Documentation\nBug Fixes\n- PostgreSQL now runs as container user (mirrored from host user) instead of postgres:postgres\n- ddev describe now works with stopped or broken containers\n- Improved support for DDEV_* environment variables in PHP-based add-ons\n- APP_DEFAULT_LOCALE is no longer overridden in CakePHP, thanks to @tyler36\n- Removed hardcoded --server-id=0 parameter from MySQL/MariaDB startup, thanks to @cyppe\n- Fixed docker-compose warnings on ddev start when project root .env file contains dollar signs\n- ddev add-on get now retries without authentication on invalid GitHub token\n- Debug and verbose output now suppressed when using --json-output/-j flag\n- Non-interactive mode now forced in non-tty environments\n- Improved container username sanitization with better fallback handling\n- Fixed blackfire-php installation for older PHP versions\n- Fixed bug with broken label in Mutagen volume when path to Docker socket is too long\n- Fixed intermittent hang in ddev auth ssh when SSH key is password-protected\n- Fixed hang in ddev start on macOS when temp directory permissions are broken after macOS upgrade (fixed in docker-compose)\nInternal Improvements\n- PHP 8.1 no longer preinstalled in ddev/ddev-webserver to reduce image size\n- Native ARM builder now used for building DDEV Docker images, thanks to @AkibaAT\n- ddev utility is now the primary command (ddev debug moved to alias)\n- Healthcheck added to ddev/ddev-xhgui image\n- Linux tests now run separately instead of in matrix, allowing single test restarts on failure\n- Improved support for CI=true in GitHub Actions\n- Vite setup documentation migrated into DDEV docs, thanks to @mandrasch for continuous support on the blog article\n- Improved quickstarts code block formatting to resolve copy/paste issues in some terminals\n- Added docker-buildx dependency for AUR installation\n- Internet detection now uses one.one.one.one instead of test.ddev.site\n- Replaced GITHUB_OWNER with DDEV_GITHUB_OWNER in https://ddev.com/install.sh\n- Switched to lightweight debian-12 image for GitHub Codespaces\n- Removed Gitpod configuration (service is no longer available)\nMinor
