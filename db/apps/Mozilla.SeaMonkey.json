Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates as well as new features and improvements to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and corporate users.\nSeaMonkey is built on the open source Mozilla Gecko engine, the same code which underlies the highly successful Thunderbird and is the base for the Firefox browser. SeaMonkey benefits from the cross-fertilization with these other projects, by gaining (and contributing) new features and the ongoing security updates which are a modern necessity. The SeaMonkey Association provides legal backing for the SeaMonkey Project.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.53.23","version":0,"site":"https://www.seamonkey-project.org/","source":"SeaMonkey e.V.","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
