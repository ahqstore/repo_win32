It provides new blocks for managing sensors and actuators connected to Arduino. There is also a sensors report board similar to the PicoBoard one.\nThe main aim of the project is attracting people to the programming world. The goal is also to provide a high level interface to Arduino programmers with functionalities such as interacting with a set of boards through user events.\nS4A:\n- Fixed issue on block watchers when displaying %t instead the sensor name\n- Fixed issue when analog input error not disappearing\n- Fixed bug when creating new Arduino object and selecting an existing connection (thanks to Vaner Anampa, Erik Bartmann and many more for reporting this bug)\n- Changed default pins and their order on Arduino blocks (as before)\n- Merged servo blocks, now pins 8, 7 and 4 can be used for standard and CR servomotors.\n- Added HTTP block (GET method) as requested by IMI (\"Institut Municipal d'Informatica\") of Barcelona\n- Updated some translation files.
