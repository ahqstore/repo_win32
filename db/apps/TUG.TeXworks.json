The goal of TeXworks is to deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use environment for users on other platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.\nAmong other things, TeXworks features an integrated PDF previewer, synchronization between the TeX files and the PDF output, and an extensible scripting interface.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.6.11","version":0,"site":"https://tug.org/","source":"TeX Users Group","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
