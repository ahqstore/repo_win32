Label and rate your files.\n- Queued file copies. Powerful batch renaming. Full archive support.\n- Find your files. Locate duplicates. Synchronize backups.\n- Assign tags and descriptions. Convert images. Edit metadata.\n- Fully multi-threaded, native 64 bit high performance code.\n\nOpus is written in native C++ multi-threaded code; compiled for the latest 64 bit CPUs, with high performance our number one design principle.\nPowerful searching, sorting, grouping, labelling and tagging features let you take control of your files like never before.\nWork with third-party tools as easily as with the built-in features. A full scripting interface, including scriptable dialogs, means your imagination is really the only limit.\n\nTry free for 30 days or Register  for an extended 60 day trial.\nPreferences\n- Added File Operations / Renaming Files / Allow rename into other directories option. Allows you to disable the feature in inline rename where files can be moved to other folders.\n- FAYT Quick Keys can now be up to 4 characters long instead of just a single key. For example, you could assign >> for command mode and >? for DOS command mode. Typing a leading key of a multi-character key puts the FAYT in the new \"mode\" mode, which shows a popup list of all modes that match the prefix typed so far. You can disable this popup if you want with the new option on the Filtering and Sorting / Find-As-You-Type page.\n\nCommands\n- Added Set FAYTFINDOPTIONS command, lets you toggle various FAYT Find Mode options from a command.\n- Buttons that use @keydown can now provide additional tooltip text for the various key combinations. For example, @keydown:shift:Opens a new window.\n- As well as Standard, Script, MS-DOS, etc, a new \"Evaluator Function\" function type is now available for buttons, hotkeys, etc. This lets you write a function in \"pure\" evaluator code. The @functype: modifier and Command.SetType() script methods now accept \"eval\" to indicate an evaluator function.\n\nScripting\n- The New Script dialog can now generate a new script from custom templates. This lets you add support for additional languages like Python. Templates should be stored in the /dopusdata/Script AddIns/Templates folder.\n- In script dialogs, you can now add items to listview controls with the AddItem/InsertItemAt methods using a vector (or JScript array) to initialise an item and its subitems at once. You can also pass a two-dimensional array to add multiple items.\n- Added Word wrap option (enabled by default) for script dialog multiline edit controls.\n- Changes to the script FSUtil.Run() method:\n  - You can now wait for the launched process without having to redirect its output. If the third argument is a string instead of a bool value, it specifies a flags value. Current flags are \"r\" for redirect output, and \"w\" for wait. (\"r\" implies \"w\" but \"w\" can be used to wait without redirecting).\n  - The string provided by the optional fourth argument will now be fed to the process stdin even if not waiting for it to finish.\n  - A new optional fifth argument which lets you specify the current directory for the launched process.\n- The Dialog.FlushMsg() method now takes two optional parameters, both wildcard strings to match against the event name and control name. Only messages matching the wildcards will be flushed.\n- Added Dialog.Controls() method for script dialogs. Returns an enumerable collection of all Control objects in the dialog.\n\nEvaluator\n- The evaluator now supports arrays. The following functions have been added to create and work with arrays: ArrayCreate, ArrayGet, ArraySet, ArrayPush, ArrayPop, ArrayErase, ArrayCopy, ArraySort, ArrayRev. Additionally the Len() function can be used to query the number of elements in an array.\n- Added Run() function to allow evaluator functions to run internal and external commands.\n- Added Dialog() function to allow evaluator functions to display simple dialogs.\n- Added GetItems() function. Returns an array of item paths from the specified tab.\n- Added Explode() and Implode() functions.\n- Added ES() function which provides a way to use C-style escaping in a string for characters like tab and CR/LF.\n- IsSelected() and FileCount() now work in function contexts even if the function itself doesn't use any files (or more accurately, if Opus thinks it doesn't use any files).\n- The Match() function can now match against an array as well as a string.\n\nOther changes\n- In the Folder Format dialog, the View tab now has a separate font setting for thumbnails mode.\n- Context-sensitive button enable/disable now works with commands that use @ifsel: to change their behaviour depending on selected file status.\n- Improved performance of some HEIC/HEIF thumbnails.\n- If a multi-key hotkey and a multi-key quick key share a prefix, the hotkey normally gets priority. However if a subsequent key matches the quick key but not the hot key, the string typed up to that point is now fed through to the FAYT.\n- The F10 information display in the standalone image viewer now includes a histogram of the image.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"13.20","version":0,"site":"https://www.gpsoft.com.au/","source":"GPSoftware","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
