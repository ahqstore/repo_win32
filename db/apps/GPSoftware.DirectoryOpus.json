If turned off, the paired folder is only read automatically when you actually switch into dual display mode.\n  - Switch to dual display automatically: Turns on dual display mode if the Lister isn't in dual mode already.\n- Added File Displays / Navigation / Cancel without warning when navigating away option. If turned on, NavLock mode will be automatically cancelled without showing an \"out-of-sync\" warning when you navigate to a location that's not below the base folder (and that doesn't have a paired folder).\n- Columns for music Track and Disc numbers can now have totals and zero padding turned off (File Display Columns / Options). The metadata panel still displays the tags as they are in the original file, so you can still edit those details.\n- When the root of a library is grouped by parent folder (or similar), the group order now reflects the order member folders have been added to the library. The new Preferences / Miscellaneous / Advanced: [Behaviour] library_sort_members option lets you revert to alphabetical sorting for member folders.\n- Added Preferences / Miscellaneous / Advanced: [Behaviour] expandable_collections option to make file collections expandable at the root level if desired (the implementation has a number of issues currently and so by default this is normally not supported).\n- On small displays, the Preferences dialog can now be resized smaller than its default size. Scrollbars will appear allowing you to access hidden content.\n\nExpandable folder improvements\n- Added two new options to Preferences / File Displays / Folder Expansion:\n  - Expand deeper level with Alt+click on expand button: If enabled, Alt+click on a folder's expansion button repeatedly expands a deeper level of folders every time. That is, the first click expands the folder as normal, the second click expands all its sub-folders, the third click expands all their sub-folders and so on.\n  - Collapse deepest level with Shift+Alt+click on expand button: If enabled, Shift+Alt+click on a folder's expansion button repeatedly collapses the deepest level of expanded folders under that item.\n- Added keywords subsequent and deepest to the Go EXPANDBRANCH command to invoke these behaviors.\n- Also added levels: keyword to Go EXPANDBRANCH which lets you expand multiple levels at once (e.g. Go EXPANDBRANCH=levels:3 would expand three levels of sub-folders automatically).\n- Split the Folder Expansion Preferences page out to two separate pages.\n\nUnattended copy\n- The error dialog for a Copy/Move operation now has an option in the Skip dropdown menu to switch into unattended mode for the remainder of the operation.\n- The progress dialog's error tab now has the option to export the list of errors to a file collection, as well as as a text/csv file.\n\nCommands\n- Added Select NEXT=sortfield and Select PREV=sortfield commands. Selects the next/previous file with a different value in the current sort column.\n- Added Select SIMILAR=sortfield command which selects all files that have the same value in the current sort column as the focus item.\n- Added groupstate and nogroupstate keywords for the Go REFRESH command, allowing you to override the Preserve group expansion state on refresh option.\n- Added Select SAVE and Select RESTORE commands.\n  - Select SAVE: Saves the current selection. By default the selection is saved within the source tab, but you can specify a name to save the selection globally.\n  - Select RESTORE: Restores a saved selection. By default restores the selection saved for the tab, but you can specify a name to restore a global selection. The ignorepaths switch allows selections to be \"copied\" from one folder to another - files are matched only on their filename rather than the whole path. The nodeselect switch prevents existing selections from being lost.\n- Added nosound and noflash switches to Clipboard SCREENSHOT command.\n- Added Go TABSWITCHER=taborder command. Displays the tab switcher with tabs listed in the same order they appear in the Lister, rather than being sorted in order of last use.\n\nScripting and evaluator\n- The StringTools.LanguageStr() script method (and similar function in the evaluator) can now return the description string of an internal icon, e.g. LanguageStr(\"icon:deletesecure\") returns \"Secure Delete\" in English.\n- The FSUtils.Run() method now supports an optional sixth argument to specify the encoding any captured output should be interpreted as. If not specified, UTF-8 is the default. Specify 0 for the current system codepage. You can also specify \"raw\" to receive the output as a Blob object and then convert it yourself using the StringTools methods.\n- The FSUtils.Run() method now supports a Map as a single parameter; other parameters can be provided as values of the Map. Values you can set are \"command\", \"showcmd\", \"flags\", \"input\", \"cd\" and \"codepage\".\n- Script and evaluation columns can now be flagged to be blurred for secure screenshots. For evaluation columns there's a new option in the column editor. For script columns, set the new blurrable property to true.\n- Added Control.ExpandGroupByName method. For grouped listviews in script dialogs, it lets you expand/collapse one or more group by name rather than having to do it one at a time via GetGroupById. For example, ctrl.ExpandGroupByName(\"*\", false); will collapse all groups.\n- The evaluator Resolve() function and FSUtil.Resolve() script method now accept the \"a\" flag to convert a path into a folder alias (if possible).\n- Button controls in script dialogs can now use the built-in button images (rather than toolbar images), by specifying the image as %x (where x is the image index).\n- The list edit control in script dialogs can now have a custom tooltip specified for its options button.\n- The HTTPRequest script object now returns any response data even in the case of an error.\n- The evaluator Resolve() function (and FSUtil.Resolve() script method) now consider user-defined path aliases as well as system aliases.\n- Changes to evaluator Resolve() function with the \"a\" flag:\n  - now handles aliases that point to other aliases better (will return the most specific alias)\n  - new \"e\" flag makes it only return an alias that exactly matches the folder, rather than appending the remainder of the path to the closest match\n  - new \"f\" flag makes it return false if the path can't be resolved to an alias (otherwise the original path is returned)\n- The evaluator IsChecked() and IsEnabled() functions can now be used to test conditions in a dual-display Lister for either file display (rather than only for the source file display.) To do this, prefix the command you're testing with left:, right:, dest: or both:. For example, IsChecked(\"both:Set VIEW=Thumbnails\") would only return true if both file displays were set to thumbnails mode.\n\nOther improvements\n- JPEG-XL images now work in the viewer if Microsoft's JPEG XL Image Extension is installed.\n- If the Preferences / File Displays / Mouse / Mouse wheel + Shift to navigate back and forward option is turned off, Shift+mousewheel now scrolls the file display (details/power mode) horizontally.\n- Go FOLDERCONTENT with resolvedirlinks now uses the icon defined for a folder shortcut (if applicable) rather than the generic folder icon.\n- Go FOLDERCONTENT with copy/move options now works on a top-level toolbar.\n- Changed how wildcard and regex path formats are tested and sorted internally. Patterns with more path separators are still tested first, but now if two patterns have the same number of separators they will be tested in alphabetical order.\n- The Text viewer no longer tries to display .STL files as text, allowing text-based STL models to fall through to a shell thumbnailer instead. (If hex viewing is enabled and no suitable thumbnailer is installed, it will still display them as hex.)\n- The Tags column is now included in the columns that are blurred in a secure screenshot.\n- The illegal_namechar_replace advanced option can now override / and \\ even if the option to allow rename into subfolders is turned on. This lets you replace one but leave the other active, if desired.\n- It's now possible to add the New and Open With menus directly to a toolbar or menu instead of in a sub-menu. (FileType NEWMENU=nosub and FileType OPENWITHMENU=nosub)\n- The Filter Bar's \"ignore extensions\" option is now automatically turned off if you use the file type menu to build a pattern matching extensions.\n- Toolbars/menus showing Folder Tab Groups now highlight the active group the same way similar menus for Styles do, rather than making the label bold. (Bold text doesn't look different enough in dark mode.)\n- The left and right mouse button glyph (used, for example, in the tooltip for a three-button button) now respects when the right button has been set as the primary mouse button.\n- In three button tooltips the hotkeys for individual buttons are now shown after their label/description rather than before.\n- The standalone viewer's status bar now displays the current scale factor of the viewed image as well as the configured zoom level.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"13.21","version":0,"site":"https://www.gpsoft.com.au/","source":"GPSoftware","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
