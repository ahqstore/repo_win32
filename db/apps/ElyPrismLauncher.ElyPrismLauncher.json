This fixes an issue where it was impossible to use a Mojang Authlib after a Ely.by Authlib has already been downloaded. If you encountered this issue, delete your libraries folder.\n  - This also reduces launch time and network bandwidth spent\n- Fixed a possible bug where the game would attempt loading authlib-injector even if the launcher was unable to fetch authlib-injector\n- Fixed an issue that caused the launcher to fetch authlib-injector even when Ely.by patching wasn't wanted\nIf you have any issues or questions, join the Discord server or open a new GitHub issue\nIf you're not sure what to download on Windows, click ElyPrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-9.5.exe","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.5","version":0,"site":"https://elyprismlauncher.github.io/","source":"ElyPrismLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
