It compares the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write Chef InSpec code. It detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation.\nChef InSpec is a run-time framework and rule language used to specify compliance, security, and policy requirements. It includes a collection of resources that help you write auditing controls quickly and easily.\nNew Features\n- Deprecation notice about moving core resource packs to their individual gems after the next major release (#7219)\n- Added the --legacy flag to the inspec automate upload command. (#7200)\n  The inspec automate upload command runs inspec check and inspec export, which were updated in Chef InSpec 5.22.36. This update led to a bug with InSpec profiles with =begin =end.\n  Use the --legacy flag with profiles where the newer export and check methods may fail to parse older profiles correctly, particularly due to limitations in AST parsing.\nCVEs\n- Fixes HTTP Request Smuggling in ruby webrick CVE-2024-47220. (#7214)\n- Fixes the REXML denial of service vulnerability CVE-2024-43398. (#7199)\n- Fixes the REXML ReDoS vulnerability CVE-2024-49761.
