It was originally forked from Open-Sankor√©, which was itself based on Uniboard.\n\n\nVersion 1.7.3\nBug fixes\n- Tried to mitigate some audio related issues on Debian, by forcing the use of the ffmpeg backend (see Known Issues for more details on the remaining bugs)\n- fixed an issue where the Windows package would not contain the good version of openssl dlls\nKnown issues\n- On any widget, select options (Drop-down lists) won't appear at the right position. Be careful as it sometimes will appear behind the left or right palette of the Board Mode.\n- Reading multiple audio files, then, within the same session, coming back to a previously played audio file end in the audio file not being played correctly, especially with short audios. Duplicate the audio to replay it without any issue, or use any other way to play audio (desktop mode, letters order interactivity, online audio and video apps like peertube, etc).\n- Some use cases remain where you can end up with documents at the same level having the same name.\n- An issue can occur, that is not clearly identified at this time, when importing an UBX, where users end up with the imported documents appearing multiple times in the documents tree, at the same level.\nLinux\n- In Desktop Mode, Gnome Dock should be set to bottom position to workaround the issue with the OpenBoard left palette not being usable from above it (cf. https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-81341 for more details).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.7.3","site":"https://github.com/OpenBoard-org/OpenBoard","source":"Open Education Foundation","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
