Additionally, Compare Populations has been. moved to the Populations band and the Script Editor was moved to the Power band.\nBug Fixes\n- File access to cloud drives has been improved for Macs .\n- Unchecking ‘Show Summary Stats’ in the table editor preferences now does indeed turn off the summary stats in exports to .csv.\n- ACS files can now be saved with a # character in the name.\n- Cluster explorer populations with less than 1% of the events are now plotted visibly in the bar chart window.\n- Cluster explorer statistics precision now responds to significant figure preference changes.\n- ‘Optimize weights’ used in combination with AutoSpill during compensation no longer causes a crash.\n- The proxy settings window OK and Cancel buttons are more accessible on Windows.\n- Statistics now displayed properly while using India as the location.\n- During installation, all FlowJo components will be packaged into a folder even when the default installation location is changed.\n- X-axis label will be displayed even if not all concatenated files have a value for a keyword defined parameter.\n- Hot keys for progressing through samples on a Mac have been re-enabled.\n- Creating a group from the Table Editor has been re-enabled.\nKnown Issues\n- Gallios LMD files do not reflect LMD defaults.\n- The Moom and Cylance applications interfere with FlowJo performance.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"10.10.0.0","site":"https://flowjo.com/","source":"FlowJo LLC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
