In 3D cabs, the driving experience is augmented with forces that shake your simulated body upon acceleration and braking, as well as in curves. Besides that, OpenBVE features a 3D positional sound system best enjoyed with surround speakers, train exteriors and timetables for the current run. Finally, via the main menu, routes and trains be easily selected to start a new session, the controls can be configured to keyboard or joystick devices, and a variety of options can be selected.\nCompared to other simulators of the genre, especially compared to commercial games, OpenBVE has its main focus on realism, not necessarily on user-friendliness. You should be willing to study operational manuals for the routes and trains you want to drive, and will in many cases not get along by just memorizing a few keystrokes. If you can identify with this focus, OpenBVE might be the right simulator for you.\nAnother pair of small fixes I'm afraid, but hopefully these are the last.\nSignificant Changes\n- Fix: Music horns not working correctly (copy + paste error)\n- Fix: Incorrectly parsed CFG length values on system using comma as decimal separator","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.11.1.2","site":"https://openbve-project.net/","source":"The OpenBVE Project","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
