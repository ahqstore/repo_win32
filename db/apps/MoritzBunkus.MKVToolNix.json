They're now removed from the codec initialization data. See #6079.\n- mkvmerge: FLAC reader: padding metadata blocks will now be removed from the codec initialization data. See #6079.\n- mkvmerge: FLAC reader: embedded Vorbis comments will now be converted into Matroska comments or track/global header fields when available (e.g. TITLE will become the segment title & track's name, LANGUAGE will become the track's language). Copying of Vorbis comments that are converted into actual Matroska tags can be prevented with the usual options, e.g. --no-track-tags. The comments will also be removed from the codec initialization data. Implements #6079.\n- mkvmerge, MKVToolNix GUI's chapter editor: when reading simple (OGM-style) chapter files & no character set is given for the file, mkvmerge will try UTF-8 first before falling back to the system's default encoding. Implements #6084.\n- MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the special drag & drop zones added in v91 are now shown by default in new installations.\n- MKVToolNix GUI: in new installations the main window will now be sized at 75% of the screen's resolution initially with a certain minimum initial size. This improves initial readability on high DPI screens that use screen scaling factors such as 150%.\n\nBug fixes\n- mkvmerge: Ogg reader: during identification the track tags are now reported properly.\n- MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: within the \"additional options\", both track-specific ones & the global ones on the \"Output\" tab, it wasn't possible to specify empty (zero-length) arguments. With the intended syntax of two consecutive single or double quotation marks the empty arguments were simply skipped. This was fixed, and it is now possible to specify e.g. --title \"\" in the global \"Additional options\" in order to force no title to be written ever. Fixes #6087.\n\nBuild system changes\n- Windows build: the packaging/windows/populate_installer_dir.sh now expects the user to pass the Saxon-HE's JAR file name to be passed with the -s or --saxon-jar parameter instead of the base directory for Saxon-HE. This allows newer versions of Saxon-HE to be used.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"92.0.0","site":"https://www.bunkus.org/","source":"Moritz Bunkus","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
