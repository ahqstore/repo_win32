It may be used to create customer-specific wizard-syle interfaces that build CLI or INI files from the generic \"templates\".\nThe typical workflow is as follows:\n- AudioCodes employee (FAE / Support / R&D) creates \"template file\" and matching \"ui file\". The former contains device configuration with specific parts of it replaced with %tags%. The latter contains definition of end-user interface that is used to get values for these %tags%.\n- The above two files (.template + .ui) are delivered to customer and placed in the same directory\n- Customer opens the wizard and chooses the specific .template file that he wants to work with\n- The wizard prompts customer to enter values for template-specific %tags% - as per the .ui file\n- When the customer completes all configuration screens, the wizard generates device configuration (INI or CLI) by expanding all %tags% and processing all #macros in the template\n- The generated configuration file can be saved to disk or loaded to the device\nSample .template and .ui files can be found in example directory.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.audiocodes.com/","source":"AudioCodes Ltd.","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
