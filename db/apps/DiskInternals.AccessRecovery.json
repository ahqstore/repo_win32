Instead, DiskInternals Access Recovery reconstructs the entire structure of a database by splitting the database record by record, and assembling the records back into a working database. All records are carefully recovered, including table data and queries.\n\nDiskInternals Access Recovery never alters the original MDB databases, always creating a new database in MS Access 2000-2003 format and exporting recovered records into the newly created database.\n\nDiskInternals Access Recovery comes equipped with Uneraser engine, making it possible to unerase deleted databases automatically. The PowerSerch engine thoroughly scans the surface of the hard drive in order to locate and recover all MS Access databases on the disk. Even if the disk is severely damaged, reformatted, or has its file system corrupted, DiskInternals Access Recovery can still reliably locate and recover Access database files.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.15","version":0,"site":"https://www.diskinternals.com/","source":"DiskInternals Research","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
