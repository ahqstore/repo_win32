Additionally, there is a preview to show the path for the selected image.\n  The maximum zoom for the editor is now configurable.\n  Pseudo HiDPI is replaced by real HiDPI.\n  The file browser has an option to show all images within subfolders too.\n  The Use embedded option for the Input Profile is available for DNGs that have an embedded DCP.\n  The Color appearance sub-tool in Selective Editing (formerly Local Adjustments) received various improvements, including simplification of the basic mode, addition of new tone mappers for Cam16, a black and white mode, and a highlight attenuation feature.\n  The White balance Tint range is expanded.\n  It is now possible to use Contrast by Detail Levels in Before Black-and-White mode while Color Appearance & Lighting is activated with CAM16.\n  Ratings and color labels can be synchronized with XMPs.\n  The Selective Editing tool received various improvements, such as a global mode for applying edits to the entire image uniformly, ΔE preview buttons for most sub-tools, and adjustable graduated filter feathering for each sub-tool.\n  The EXIF modified date-time is now added to saved images.\n  RawTherapee can now read 12-bit Panasonic raw files encoded in the v6 format, such as those from the DC-GH5M2.\n  RawTherapee can now read Panasonic raw files encoded in the v8 format, such as those from the DC-GH6, DC-S5M2, and DC-S5M2X.\n  RawTherapee can now read Fujifilm lossy-compressed raw files.\n  JPEG XL images can now be opened.\n  There is a new option to use lens corrections from the file metadata. It works for compatible raw images from Fujifilm, Olympus / OM Digital Solutions (distortion and chromatic aberration corrections only), and Sony. Corrections embedded in DNGs can also be used.\n  RawTherapee can leverage LibRaw (enabled by default) to read raw images. It adds the ability to read additional raw formats, such as Sony lossless compression, and improved support for some cameras.\n  Added or improved support for cameras, raw formats and color profiles (not including LibRaw and color matrices for dcraw):\n    FUJIFILM GFX 100 (PDAF lines filter)\n    FUJIFILM GFX 100S (DCP, PDAF lines filter)\n    FUJIFILM GFX 100 II (PDAF lines filter)\n    Fujifilm X-H2S\n    Nikon Z 8 (DCP)\n    Nikon Z 9 (DCP)\n    Nikon Z f (DCP)\n    OM Digital Solutions TG-7\n    Panasonic DC-G9M2\n    Panasonic DC-GH5M2\n    Panasonic DC-GH6\n    Panasonic DC-S5M2\n    Panasonic DC-S5M2X\n    Sony ILCE-1 (Pixel shift)\n    Sony ILCE-6700\n    Sony ILCE-7CR (PDAF lines filter)\n    Sony ILCE-7RM4 (PDAF lines filter)\n    Sony ILCE-7RM5 (PDAF lines filter)\n    SONY ILCE-9M3\nLocal Adjustments\n  Local Adjustments is now known as “Selective Editing”.\n\nLibRaw\n  LibRaw is a software component used to read raw files. RawTherapee had always used a different raw file reader: an enhanced version of dcraw. dcraw has not been updated in 6 years, making it a burden on RawTherapee developers to support new cameras. Starting in 5.11, RawTherapee can use LibRaw to read raw files. If LibRaw determines it cannot read a raw file, RawTherapee will fall back to the enhanced dcraw. Official packages distributed by the RawTherapee team contain an enhanced LibRaw. Unofficial packages distributed by 3rd parties may decide to use a different version of LibRaw, which may not support as many cameras.\n\n  Switching to LibRaw is a significant change. Although LibRaw originated from dcraw and the RawTherapee team made an effort to ensure the smoothest transition, there may be some raw files that LibRaw cannot handle as adequately as the enhanced dcraw. If you encounter this scenario, please submit a bug report as described below in Reporting Bugs. LibRaw can be disabled in the preferences. Keep in mind the enhanced dcraw cannot read certain raw images that LibRaw can. LibRaw will become mandatory in a future version of RawTherapee, so don’t keep those bugs to yourself!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.11","site":"http://www.rawtherapee.com/","source":"rawtherapee.com","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0 License","resources":null,"verified":false}
