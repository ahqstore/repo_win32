Cross-country comparability is enabled by coding the policy systems of the EU Member States according to a common framework based on a standard set of modelling conventions. The EUROMOD platform is highly flexible but also organised, documented, validated and transparent. Underpinning the model is the purpose-built software comprising a user-friendly interface, supplemented by extended functionalities (plugins and add-ons) for special purpose analysis. The software is used in many country-specific models around the world.\nOriginally maintained, developed and managed by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) of the University of Essex, since 2021 EUROMOD is maintained, developed and managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, in collaboration with Eurostat and national teams from the EU countries. The model is open source since December 2020 (before December 2020 it was open access), with an increasing number of users across Europe and beyond. There are now several hundred active users from a range of institutional backgrounds, helping bridge the gap between academic research and policymaking.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.8.3","site":"https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/","source":"European Commission - Joint Research Centre","license_or_tos":"EUPL-1.2","resources":null,"verified":false}
