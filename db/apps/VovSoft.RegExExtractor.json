One of its advantages is that it allows batch processing, enabling you to perform searches within multiple files at the same time.\n\nBefore clicking the \"Start\" button, you should drag'n'drop files or select the folder to scan. File masks are also supported. You can enter any regular expression (URLs, postal codes, phone numbers, dates, and many others). The results can be easily exported to a file and saved for future use.\n\nWhen you select a matched text, it will show its source file. You have the option to export all matched texts in TXT format or texts along with their corresponding source files in CSV format.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.0.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
