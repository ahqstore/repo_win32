We’ve also begun replacing WinRing0 with PawnIO (safer; fewer AV false positives) although this is only partial implementation for now, as power manipulation still uses WinRing0. On popular request, settings will now live in %LocalApplicationData%. During first launch, a backup is automatically written in %MyDocuments%.\nDevice Support\n- Lenovo Legion Go 2 — full device support (known issue: left controller gyro Z axis is reverted, we encourage you in using right controller for gyro, under the device page settings).\n- AYANEO Flip DS 1S — full device support (including bottom screen brightness control).\n- MSI Claw - 10F BIOS partial support (we strongly discourage anyone to deploy this BIOS as it causes issues with the top right OEM button).\n- Added AMD CPU support for Strix Point, Dragon Range, Fire Range, HX370 (Pro), Krackan Point.\nSystem Usage Reduction\n- Reduced CPU usage in DInputController.\n- Lower CPU cost in HidLibrary I/O.\n- Reduced ThreadPool pressure in RaiseInputsUpdatedAsync.\n- Lowered CPU usage in RadioMonitor.\n- Lighter CPU path via LibreHardwareMonitor class adjustments.\n- SDL controllers now use Tick() instead of input pumping (helps CPU).\n- Updated WPF PresentationCore for stability/perf.\nNew & Updated\n- Layout Mapping: Trigger to Button options.\n- SDL: updated to SDL3 3.2.24.\n- fr-FR translation refresh by @moi952.\nNavigation & UI\n- Gamepad UI navigation now supports HyperlinkButton.\n- Bottom bar buttons: click behavior fixed and consistent.\n- ProfilesPage shows saved Windows settings next to live values.\n- Improved screen friendly-name detection.\nStability & Resume\n- Reduced resume delays from sleep/hibernation.\n- More stable virtual controller on resume.\n- New setting: Unhide controller on disconnect.\n- Improved controller unhide when app closes.\nFixes\n- Rendering — UI could fail after toggling GPU acceleration.\n- Rendering (resume) — UI not drawing after sleep/hibernation.\n- Controllers — Infinite rumble after power-cycle while rumbling.\n- Controllers (SDL) — Trigger mapping to LB/LBSoft/RB/RBFull (DualShock/DualSense/…).\n- Preferred device — Better selection when plugging/unplugging.\n- Hotkeys — Default hotkeys deploy if none found; keyboard-triggered hotkeys with SDL.\n- MSI Claw (DInput) — Crash while controller was cycling.\n- AsusACPI — Resume stability.\n- CPU telemetry — Power/temperature readings corrected (requires PawnIO).\n- Favorites — Sub-profile management reliability.\n- Main Window — Visibility in Task View when minimized.\n- About page — Device illustration.\n- IGDB — Artwork download flow.\n- QuickTools (AYANEO Flip) — Touch keyboard height.\n- Misc crashes and exceptions hardened.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.28.1.4","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Valkirie","source":"BenjaminLSR","license_or_tos":"CC-NC-SA 4.0 License","resources":null,"verified":false}
