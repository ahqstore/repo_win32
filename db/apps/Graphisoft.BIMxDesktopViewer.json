BIMx features the ‘BIMx hyper-model’ – allowing non-design professionals to explore and fully understand architectural design intent, view project deliverables, and access element level BIM data. BIMx links the 3D model with the relevant 2D documentation layouts, providing a seamless way to view the 3D cutaway model in the context of a 2D layout — and vice versa.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2022.4567.0","site":"https://graphisoft.com/","source":"GRAPHISOFT SE","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
