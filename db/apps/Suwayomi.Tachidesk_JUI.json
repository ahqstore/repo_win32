This will allow you to configure your server when its running. I was able to add all the new settings as well! This was majorly needed due to the extension repo requirements, you can now add them in JUI under Settings -> Server!\nI did end up removing a lot of server-startup settings, if you see anything you configured reset, you can just toggle it with the new setting location.\nRename to Suwayomi-JUI\nWe are now changing from the Tachidesk naming to Suwayomi, see reasoning here. JUI is now following the new naming scheme.\nMac M1 build\nJUI now includes a Mac M1 build! This is thanks to Github actions finally adding M1 runners, allowing us to create builds on them!\nUpdate to Suwayomi-Server v1.0.0\nSuwayomi-Server has gotten a lot of new stuff lately, I hope to use it all in JUI eventually! The internal server has been updated so you can still get a lot of new features and fixes from just updating JUI!\nBugfixes\n- Fix reader memory leak, will also reduce CPU usage in the reader\n- Fix backup export\n- Fix library update subscription with Suwayomi-Server v1.0.0\n- Probably more then I can think of now\nTranslators!\nWe are currently looking for translators, hit us up on Discord for advice on how to translate Suwayomi-JUI on Weblate\nTranslations are currently provided for:\n- English\n- Arabic\n- Chinese (Simplified)\n- Chinese (Traditional)\n- Czech\n- Dutch\n- French\n- German\n- Hindi\n- Indonesian\n- Italian\n- Kazakh\n- Norwegian Bokmål\n- Persian\n- Portuguese (Brazil)\n- Russian\n- Spanish\n- Swedish\n- Tamil\n- Thai\n- Tigrinya\n- Turkish\n- Ukrainian\n- Vietnamese","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.3.3","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Suwayomi","source":"Suwayomi","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
