Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nChanged\n- When seeding random number generators with time(NULL), the result of getpid() is no longer also mixed in. Previously this was the case on non-Windows platforms, impeding reproducibility and portability.\nFixed\n- In the CMake build system, when WITH_SMYRNA is AUTO or unset, Smyrna enabling depends on the presence of Pangocairo.\n- In the CMake build system, versions of dot with plugins built in are only linked against enabled plugins. #2795","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.1.1","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
