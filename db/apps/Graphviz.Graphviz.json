Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nChanged\n- The pre-built macOS package for Autotools is now a .pkg file instead of a tarball of binaries. #2726, !4348\n- In the CMake build system, whether Ghostscript-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GHOSTSCRIPT={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2735\nFixed\n- Points generated as curves by the dot layout algorithm are once again placed correctly. This was a regression in Graphviz 14.0.0. #2734","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.0.1","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
