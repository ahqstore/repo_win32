Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nChanged\n- Quartz plugin code paths to support older macOS and iOS versions have been restored. Their removal was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.0.\n- In the CMake build system, whether Quartz-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_QUARTZ={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.\n- dot_builtins, when compiled with the CMake build system, now supports the Quartz plugin if it is enabled at build time.\nFixed\n- Memory corruption when using the Java bindings to render to a string has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.49.0.\n- A minor typo in the gvpr(3) man page has been fixed.\n- Calling gvpr(â€¦, NULL) no longer causes null pointer dereferences.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.0.2","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
