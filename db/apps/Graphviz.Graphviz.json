Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nChanged\n- Internal timing operations now use clock() on all platforms (previously this was only used on Windows). This should result in more accurate timing in verbose informational messages.\n- Building Graphviz with expat < 2.2.8 is no longer supported on MinGW.\nFixed\n- diffimg now notices failures when calling Ghostscript to convert PS images to PNG and exits instead of continuing.\n- dtstat no longer reads/writes out of bounds memory on platforms where sizeof(int) < sizeof(size_t). This was a regression in Graphviz 7.0.1.\n- Some incorrect variable types in the libcdt man page have been corrected.\n- gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a binary tree with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -t32).\n- gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a hypercube with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -h32).\n- A null pointer dereference in edge pair analysis within the circo algorithm has been fixed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.0.4","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
