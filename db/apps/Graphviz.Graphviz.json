Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nChanged\n- In the CMake build system, whether GTK-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GTK={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714\n- The CMake build system now includes man pages for the circo, dot2gxl, fdp, gv2gml, gv2gxl, gvmap.sh, gxl2dot, neato, sfdp, and twopi aliases. #1753, #2530\n- In the CMake build system, whether Poppler-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_POPPLER={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714\n- The gvpr -a option is no longer limited to 100 arguments. It is limited now only by available memory.\n- In the CMake build system, whether librsvg-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_RSVG={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714\n- In the CMake build system, whether libwebp-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_WEBP={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714\n- Breaking: The CDT_VERSION macro has been updated to reflect the last time an API-breaking change was made. This should have happened in Graphviz 9.0.0 and then multiple other releases since then. #2722\n- In the CMake build system, whether X11-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_X={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714\n- The graphviz_version.h header includes macros GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MAJOR, GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MINOR, GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_PATCH for compile-time discrimination based on the Graphviz version. #2716\n- The CMake build system no longer allows overriding the Graphviz version with -DVERSION=….\n- Breaking: The agcanonStr function has been removed.\nFixed\n- The CMake build system no longer installs an sfdp alias when SFDP is disabled (-Dwith_sfdp=OFF).\n- The plugin version in pre-built Fedora and Rocky Linux packages has been corrected 6 → 8. This change should have happened in Graphviz 13.0.0.\n- Empty HTML-like labels (<>) are once again processed successfully. This was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.0. #2727\n- Some typos in the cgraph man page have been fixed.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
