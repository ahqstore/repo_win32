Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser.\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\nFixed\n- When filtering attribute lists, Smyrna no longer accesses out of bounds memory or misses results.\n- osage should now handle clusters that become empty when nodes are incorrectly assigned to sibling clusters. #2721","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"14.0.5","version":0,"site":"https://graphviz.org","source":"Graphviz","license_or_tos":"Common Public License Version 1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
