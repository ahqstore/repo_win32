This did not work in 6104 due to a GCC change that woke up a bug in binutils. To avoid problems, it is still advisable to install all of Rtools to a local disk and use it from there.\nGCC has been patched to avoid a bug in the C++ library causing incorrect results of complex exponentiation.\nHDF5 is now built with Fortran support.\nUpstream MXE changes have been merged from a31368b037221d56bcfcfd8c546b89adffe9ea04, with additional updates as detailed below.\nThese packages have been updated:\nabseil-cpp 20240116.1 to 20240722.0\narmadillo 12.8.0 to 12.8.4\nblosc 1.21.5 to 1.21.6\nboost 1.84.0 to 1.85.0\ncairo 1.18.0 to 1.18.2\ncfitsio 3450 to 4.5.0\ncmake-host 3.28.3 to 3.30.4\ncurl 8.6.0 to 8.10.1\nexpat 2.6.0 to 2.6.3\nffmpeg 4.2.9 to 7.1\nfluidsynth 2.3.4 to 2.3.6\nfreeglut 3.4.0 to 3.6.0\nfreetype 2.13.2 to 2.13.3\nfreetype-bootstrap 2.13.2 to 2.13.3\nfribidi 1.0.13 to 1.0.16\ngcc 13.2.0 to 13.3.0\ngcc-host 13.2.0 to 13.3.0\ngdal 3.8.4 to 3.9.3\ngdk-pixbuf 2.42.10 to 2.42.12\ngeos 3.12.1 to 3.12.2\ngettext 0.22.4 to 0.22.5\nglib 2.78.4 to 2.82.1\ngnutls 3.8.3 to 3.8.6\ngrpc 1.61.1 to 1.66.2\nharfbuzz 8.3.0 to 10.0.1\nimagemagick 7.1.1-28 to 7.1.1-39\nintel-tbb 2021.11.0 to 2021.13.0\njasper 4.2.0 to 4.2.4\njson-c 0.17 to 0.18\njsoncpp 1.9.5 to 1.9.6\nlibarchive 3.7.2 to 3.7.7\nlibass 0.17.1 to 0.17.3\nlibassuan 2.5.6 to 2.5.7\nlibdeflate 1.19 to 1.22\nlibffi 3.4.3 to 3.4.6\nlibgcrypt 1.10.3 to 1.11.0\nlibgit2 1.7.2 to 1.8.1\nlibgpg_error 1.47 to 1.50\nlibgsf 1.14.52 to 1.14.53\nlibidn 1.36 to 1.42\nlibidn2 2.3.0 to 2.3.7\nliblqr-1 0.4.2 to 0.4.3\nlibpng 1.6.42 to 1.6.44\nlibraw 0.21.2 to 0.21.3\nlibrtmp f1b83c1 to 6f6bb13\nlibsbml 5.20.2 to 5.20.4\nlibsodium 1.0.19 to 1.0.20\nlibssh 0.10.6 to 0.11.1\nlibunistring 1.1 to 1.2\nlibuv 1.48.0 to 1.49.1\nlibvpx 1.14.0 to 1.14.1\nlibwebp 1.3.2 to 1.4.0\nlibxml2 2.12.5 to 2.12.9\nlibxslt 1.1.39 to 1.1.42\nlibzmq 3b26401 to 90b4f41\nlz4 1.9.4 to 1.10.0\nminizip 4.0.4 to 4.0.7\nmsmpi 72e0ee2 to fe5f73f\nnlopt 2.7.1 to 2.8.0\nopenblas 0.3.26 to 0.3.28\nopencv 4.9.0 to 4.10.0\nopenjpeg 2.5.0 to 2.5.2\nopenssl 3.2.1 to 3.3.2\npango 1.51.2 to 1.54.0\npcre2 10.43 to 10.44\npixman 0.43.2 to 0.43.4\npoppler 24.02.0 to 24.10.0\npostgresql 13.14 to 13.16\nproj 9.3.1 to 9.4.1\nprotobuf 25.3 to 25.5\nre2 2024-02-01 to 2024-07-02\nsdl2 2.28.5 to 2.30.8\nsqlite 3450100 to 3460100\ntiff 4.6.0 to 4.7.0\nwavpack 5.6.0 to 5.7.0\nxz 5.4.6 to 5.6.3\nzstd 1.5.5 to 1.5.6","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.4.6335","site":"https://www.r-project.org/","source":"The R Foundation","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
