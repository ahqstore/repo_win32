You just pick pics, a game and SteaScree will do the rest.\n- Qt 5.9.1.\n- Added \"JPEG Quality\" spinbox for situations, when SteaScree converts image to JPEG. It happens if the input image is too large for Steam Cloud or if it has non-JPEG format. Defaults to 95.\n- Slight redesign. Status field is now visible all the time.\n- Now the app switches to debugging to file automatically, when the it is not ran in Qt Creator.\n- Added a logic to save debug info to the debug.log file.\n- Fixed the bug when the app was crashing, if the Steam user personal name (nickname) was not found in config files. Closes issue #16.\n- Removed some unused methods.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.5.4","site":"https://github.com/awthwathje","source":"Foyl","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
