When a new person joins they will also be\nsynchronised. Syncplay also includes text-based chat so you can discuss a video as you watch it (or you could use third-party Voice over\nIP software to talk over a video).\nNew features:\n- Added 'readiness override' feature. If you can control a remove, you can set someone a ready or not ready through the context menu in the list of who is playing what. Only works if the server is running v.1.7.4, but can change status for people using older clients. Adds the folderSearchWarningThreshold' setting to the Synclay INI.
