Files Inspector now\n    accurately identifies traces and calculates the disk space occupied by Steam and\n    games installed through it.\n  - Added dependency detection for related applications. If a user attempts to uninstall Steam\n    without first removing games installed via the platform, a warning will be displayed. This\n    ensures games do not become inoperable, as they may depend on Steamâ€™s framework\n    (uninstallation must follow a reverse order: games first, then Steam).\n  - Fixed duplicate applications in the list that occurred in some cases. For\n    example, when AOMEI Partition Assistant was installed, a redundant entry named\n    AOMEI Partition Assistant_is1, which served no purpose, would be added to the\n    list.\n- When system font scaling is changed between application launches, it now\n  maintains correct window proportions.\n- Bug fixed: Applications and Games section: When uninstalling COMODO Internet Security Pro, the\n  standard uninstaller did not work.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.30","site":"https://www.chemtable.com/about_us.htm","source":"ChemTable Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
