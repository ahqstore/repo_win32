It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test LLMs across different inference engines and platforms.\nHighlights\n- Qwen 3 Support!\n- Updated Llama.cpp fixes installation issues for some users and now runs most recent models (including Gemma 3 and Qwen 3)\n- Mac specific GPU metrics on Computer page supplied by MacMon library\nMany bug fixes including:\n- fixed inaccurate token count in interact tab\n- cloud-hosted apps now automatically look for API server on the origin machine, not localhost\n- filter plugins to those supported by server architecture\n- option to delete models from Hugging Face cache when removing from Transformer Lab\n- times show up correctly in train/eval tabs when server and app are in different timezones\nWhat's Changed\n- Show Dataset Name on Data card if available by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/414\n- Have the Cloud App look for the API on the current server by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/396\n- Add MacMon Specific Metrics by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/400\n- Add filtering based on the supports field for interact in loader plugins by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/399\n- Fix Token Count in Interact tab by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/397\n- Replace workflow Run display with a table by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/401\n- Auto update plugins by enabling a setting in the Settings tab by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/391\n- Improve the look of workflow nodes by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/402\n- Fix start time to not show future times by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/404\n- Fix the app restart on crash by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/405\n- Add graph for VRAM usage in header for MLX by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/411\n- Delete models from HF cache by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/410\nFull Changelog (part 1): https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2\nFull Changelog (part 2): https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/compare/v0.14.2...v0.15.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.15.0","site":"https://transformerlab.ai/","source":"Ali Asaria","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
