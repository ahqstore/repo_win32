It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test LLMs across different inference engines and platforms.\nHighlights\n- Visualize model activations on MLX and Fastchat!\n- Plugins: update all at once, show which are supported on your architecture\n- Enhanced model provenance\n- Improvements to pre-training to support making larger models\n- Many backend bug fixes\nThis release also introduces a pretty significant update to how we handle tasks on the backend that will allow us to launch a powerful workflow GUI in the next couple of releases!\nFull github log\n- Workflow by @sanjaycal in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/336\n- fix add recipe from yaml with tasks by @sanjaycal in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/339\n- Show if a plugin will work on your machine by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/337\n- Fix eval screen by @sanjaycal in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/340\n- Filter by experiment ID by @sanjaycal in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/342\n- Fix/improve embeddings page by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/341\n- Add model activations in Interact tab by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/343\n- Fix generate and eval modal for enabling editing and proper tab display by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/344\n- Add MLX server in the under construction sign for Model Activations by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/345\n- Fix/remove calls to node process to make cloud app work by @dadmobile in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/347\n- Add/update-all-plugins-button by @aliasaria in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/348\n- Fix things broken by Tasks by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/346\n- Add prettier as default formatter for javascript stuff by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/349\n- Enhance how model provenance looks and make it working for chains by @deep1401 in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/350\n- Add code to update Run button state on experiment update to avoid UI delay by @dadmobile in https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/pull/351\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app/compare/v0.11.2...v0.12.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.12.0","site":"https://transformerlab.ai/","source":"Ali Asaria","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
