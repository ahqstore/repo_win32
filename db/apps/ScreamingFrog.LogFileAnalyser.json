Some of the common uses include\n- View and analyse exactly which URLs Googlebot & other search bots are able to crawl, when and how frequently.\n- Discover all response codes, broken links and errors that search engine bots have encountered while crawling your site.\n- Get insight to which search bots crawl most frequently, how many URLs are crawled each day and the total number of bot events.\n- Find temporary and permanent redirects encountered by search bots, that might be different to those in a browser or simulated crawl.\n- Analyse your most and least crawled URLs & directories of the site, to identify waste and improve crawl efficiency.\n- Import and match any data with a 'URLs' column against log file data. So import crawls, directives, or external link data for advanced analysis.\n\nAnalyse 1k log events for free, or buy a Log File Analyser licence for £99 Per Year to remove the limit.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.4","version":0,"site":"https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/","source":"Screaming Frog Ltd.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
