It lets you securely deliver remote desktops and application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device, over varying network conditions. By using Amazon DCV with Amazon EC2, you can run graphics-intensive applications remotely on Amazon EC2 instances. You can then stream the results to more modest client machines, which eliminates the need for expensive dedicated workstations.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.4.88.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.nice-software.com/","source":"Amazon Web Services, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
