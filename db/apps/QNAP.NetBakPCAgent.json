You can easily connect your Windows Client with QNAP NAS in just a few clicks and create backup jobs. NetBak PC Agent also supports restoration without shutting down for greater usage flexibility.\n[Important Notes]\n- NetBak PC Agent has been renamed to HDP PC Agent. This name change is part of a unified naming strategy across QNAP's backup product line and reflects the product's alignment with the HDP (Hybrid Data Protection) ecosystem. Existing features or configurations are not affected.\n- Older versions of the operating system require manually installing .NET Framework 4.7.2.\n[New Features]\n- HDP PC Agent can now be deployed across multiple PCs that use Windows AD GPO.\n- Settings for performing full backups have been added to backup schedule settings and include flexible weekly and monthly scheduling options and backup failure behavior options.\n- The UI has been comprehensively improved with a new look & feel, more streamlined navigation, and increased overall usability.\n[Enhancements]\n- Windows backups now consume less storage without any loss of data integrity or restore reliability. Note: certain system files are now excluded from snapshots.\n- Added an option to automatically wake up a sleeping PC at a scheduled time so that HDP PC Agent can complete backup jobs.\n- If logging into a NAS which is in a high availability cluster, HDP will automatically redirect you to login to the cluster IP (CIP), making the login process more convenient and improving job continuity after a switchover.\n[Fixed Issues]\n- HDP PC Agent now successfully connects to the NAS without showing errors even if the Bareos configuration file on the PC is corrupted.\n- HDP PC Agent now successfully connects to the NAS when the PC contains a faulty hard drive.\n- HDP PC Agent no longer fails to sometimes backup the C: volume with the error “Failed to synthesize the backup volume”.\n- Fixed issues that occur when creating HDP PC Agent boot drives and improved error handling during the USB drive preparation step.\n- Improved handling when backing up PCs whose volumes contain partial cluster damage, reducing unexpected backup failures.\n- The HDP PC Agent app now displays a helpful error message when the application opens informing Windows domain users that they do not have the required Windows permissions to run HDP PC Agent.\n- Fixed several issues involving network connection and backups, improving overall job stability.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.3.0","version":0,"site":null,"source":"QNAP Systems, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
