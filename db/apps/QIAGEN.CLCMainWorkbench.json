This problem did not affect log elements generated by analyses run on a CLC Server or on the cloud.\n  - The following fixes affecting history information in outputs generated by workflows run on the cloud:\n    - Details of the workflow run (name, version, and where relevant, build id) were not present in the history of Workflow Result Metadata elements.\n    - History information in outputs generated using installed workflows did not contain the correct workflow build-id.\n    - History information in outputs from workflows launched from the workflow editor contained a workflow build-id when there should not have been one.\n- Various minor bug fixes\n- CVEs fixed in this release include:\n  - CVE-2025-67735\n  - CVE-2025-12183\n  - CVE-2025-66566","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"26.0.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.qiagen.com/","source":"QIAGEN Aarhus A/S","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
