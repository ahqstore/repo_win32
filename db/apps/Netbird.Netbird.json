NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.\nSecure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.\n🚀 New Feature: netbird expose\nWe're excited to introduce netbird expose --- a simple and secure way to expose your local services through the NetBird reverse proxy.\n⚡ Expose Local Services with Protection\nExpose a local HTTP server:\nnetbird expose 8080\nThis instantly publishes your local service via NetBird's reverse proxy.\nYou can enhance the exposure with built-in protection and customization:\n🔐 With PIN protection (6 digits)\nnetbird expose 3000 --with-pin 123456\n🔑 With password protection and name prefix\nnetbird expose 8080 --with-password my-secret --with-name-prefix my-app\n👥 Restrict by SSO user groups\nnetbird expose 8080 --with-user-groups engineering,devops\n🌐 Use a custom domain (pre-configured in your account)\nnetbird expose 8080 --with-custom-domain app.example.com\nSupported Flags\n-  --with-pin string --- Protect the exposed service with a 6-digit\n  PIN\\\n-  --with-password string --- Add password protection\\\n-  --with-user-groups strings --- Restrict access to specific user\n  groups\\\n-  --with-custom-domain string --- Specify a custom domain\\\n-  --with-name-prefix string --- Prefix the generated service name\\\n-  --protocol string --- Protocol to use (http or https, default\n  http)\n⚠️ NetBird Cloud support is coming soon with hosted proxy nodes. ⚠️\nLearn more at: https://docs.netbird.io/manage/reverse-proxy/expose-from-cli\nOr watch the video below:\nClient Improvements\n- Stopped upstream retry loop immediately on context cancellation.\n  #5403\n- Fixed busy-loop in network monitor routing socket on macOS/BSD.\n  #5424\n- Fixed missed sleep/wakeup events on macOS.\n  #5418\n- Removed connection semaphore to simplify connection handling.\n  #5419\n- Skipped UAPI listener in netstack mode.\n  #5397\n- Simplified DNS logging by removing domain list from log output.\n  #5396\n- Excluded Flow domain from caching to prevent TLS failures.\n  #5433\n- Added non-default socket file discovery support.\n  #5425\nClient Service Expose\n- Introduced client service expose feature across client and management.\n  #5411\n- Refactored expose feature by moving business logic from gRPC to manager layer.\n  #5435\nProxy Improvements\n- Added access log cleanup.\n  #5376\n- Implemented access log sorting.\n  #5378\n- Sent proxy updates on account deletion.\n  #5375\n- Added pre-shared key (PSK) support to proxy.\n  #5377\nManagement Improvements\n- Refactored network map component assembly.\n  #5193\n- Added custom domain counts and service metrics to self-hosted metrics.\n  #5414\nSelf-Hosted Enhancements\n- Added support for activity store engine in the combined server.\n  #5406\n- Added Embedded IdP metrics for improved observability.\n  #5407\nFull Changelog: v0.65.3...v0.66.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.66.0","version":0,"site":"https://netbird.io/","source":"NetBird GmbH","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
