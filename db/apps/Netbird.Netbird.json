NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.\nSecure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.\nWhat's New\nCustom DNS Zones\nNetBird now supports private DNS zones, allowing you to host DNS records directly within your network without external DNS servers.\nCreate zones like internal.company.io, add A, AAAA, or CNAME records, and distribute them to specific peer groups. Resolution happens locally on peers, and records propagate automatically when group membership\nchanges. With search domain support enabled, peers can query short names like api instead of the full api.internal.company.io.\nCustom zones take precedence over nameserver configurations, giving you control over how specific domains resolve within your network. This works well with routed networks—map friendly names to private IPs behind\nrouting peers, and NetBird handles both DNS resolution and traffic routing. Your teams access postgres.internal instead of remembering 192.168.0.68.\nZone distribution is group-based, so different teams can see different records for the same zone, or have access to entirely separate zones.\nUse Cases\n- Environment separation — Distinct zones for production, staging, and development, distributed only to relevant teams\n- Routed network resources — DNS names for services in data centers or cloud VPCs accessed through routing peers\n- Split-horizon DNS — Internal-only resolution for domains that resolve differently outside your network\nScreenshots\nCreate a new Zone:\nCreate a new record:\nView all records:\nLearn more at:\nCustom Zones\nCustom zone records for routed resources\nDNS & Networking Improvements\n- Ensured musl compatibility by chasing CNAMEs in the local resolver.\n  #5046\n- Improved DNS resolution flow by falling through the DNS chain for custom DNS zones.\n  #5081\n- Changed priority between local and DNS route handlers for more predictable routing.\n  #5106\n- Fixed netstack upstream DNS handling and added WASM debug methods.\n  #4648\nClient Improvements\n- Fixed WASM peer connections to lazy peers.\n  #5097\n- Added fallback handling for invalid loginuid in ui-post-install.sh.\n  #5099\n- Removed duplicate audience checks in the client.\n  #5117\nManagement Enhancements\n- Added Custom DNS zones support.\n  #4849\n- Added configuration compatibility checks during startup.\n  #5087\n- Optimized external cache access by fetching all users in a single request.\n  #5104\n- Adapted rate limiting behavior.\n  #5080\n- Fixed SSH server audience validation across management and client.\n  #5105\n- Skipped email_verified validation when not present in IdP responses.\n  #5118\n- Added IdP timeout configuration via environment variable.\n  #4647\nInfrastructure & Security\n- Introduced embedded STUN support for relay and STUN components.\n  #5062\n- Added a Quickstart reverse proxy assistant to simplify initial setup.\n  #5100\n- Upgraded Alpine Linux from 3.22.2 to 3.23.2 for security hardening.\n  #5119\nOther Changes\n- Added a hiring announcement with a link to careers.netbird.io.\n  #5095\nNew Contributors\n- @nsadeghi97 made their first contribution in #5095\n- @ressys1978 made their first contribution in #4647\nFull Changelog: v0.62.2...v0.63.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.63.0","version":0,"site":"https://netbird.io/","source":"NetBird GmbH","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
