This version of Mailspring upgrades the app to Electron 33 and Chromium 130, ensuring the latest upstream bug fixes, security patches and improvements are available in the app.\n- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is no longer supported. macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later is required.\n- We are considering dropping Ubuntu 16, Ubuntu 18 and other Linux releases >6 years old. If this would impact you, please let me know at ben@foundry376.com! It's getting harder to build a mailsync binary because our CI services are dropping support.\nFixes:\n- Mailspring now conforms to the AppStream metainfo standard.
