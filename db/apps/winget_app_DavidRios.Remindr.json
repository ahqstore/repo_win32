This is currently an experimental feature (can be enabled under 'Advanced') since there are some slight visual bugs left to work out.\n- Spellcheck can now be toggled on/off. No need to deal with distracting squiggly red lines - spell how you like!\nChanges- Task/task group animations significantly improved- Removing tasks from a group no longer results in the remaining tasks instantly going to their new place - they are now animated, resulting a much smoother overall appearance.\n- Removing tasks from a group is now instantaneous - they are immediately popped out of the list, and surrounding tasks will immediately fill in that new gap.\n\nBugfixes- Offline startup mode now loads tasks properly, following a bug introduced in v2.1.6","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.1.7","site":"https://github.com/MrDavidRios/remindr_releases","source":"David Rios","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
