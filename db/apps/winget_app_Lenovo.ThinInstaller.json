Thin Installer searches for the update packages from a repository that you create. The repository can be created on your local hard drive, a network share, a web server, or external media such as a CD, DVD, or USB hard drive. When Thin Installer finishes installing applicable packages, no registry keys relating to Thin Installer exist - thus the user only needs to delete the folder containing Thin Installer to remove all files associated with Thin Installer and the associated repository\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.04.02.0024","site":"https://www.lenovo.com","source":"Lenovo","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
