Lists default to scrolling.\n- feat: preset themes\n  - Adds the Default (AMOLED) theme.\n  - Buttons, inputs, and toggles are now all properly reactive.\n  - Fixes color issues with the Default (Dark) theme and many transparency issues.\n  - Improves accessibility with tooltips on icon-only buttons.\n- feat: Spanish (Latin American) subtitle language\n- fix: missing subtitles\n  - Primarily fixes missing subtitles from release groups like Yameii.\n- fix: external player auto-play\n  - Fixes external player auto-play not functioning when loading a file or switching episodes.\n  - Fixes external player reopening when clicking to play the episode before auto-play is triggered.\n- fix: file manager sorting and reactivity\n  - Files in the file manager will now be properly grouped by series, sorted by season, and episode number.\n  - Files that had their series change will immediately be reflected in the File Manager without having to re-open it.\n- fix: episode list scaling and summary\n  - Fixes issues on Android where lines were partially cropped due to exceeding the summary size.\n  - Summary is now properly limited to the max lines denoted by ellipsis.\n- fix: Android hover buttons\n  - Buttons that change state when hovering on desktop should not be highlighted after clicking them on Android. Now they are properly deselected after performing the button action.\n- fix: airing series triggering section update\n  - Series that are airing have a countdown to the episode, which would cause the section to update when they didn't need to after a new query was completed.\n  - All unnecessary keys have been removed from media data to prevent section updates.\n- fix: indefinite dub delays\n  - Dubbed series that have production suspended but have the sub finished will now properly show Dub production as suspended.\n- fix: stale schedule data\n  - Fixes a very rare edge case that would result in the episode feeds or schedule not updating, resulting in stale data as the manifest is saved.\n- fix: incorrect regex\n  - Resulted in torrent cards showing incorrect tags.\n- fix: janky overlay check\n  - Each time a file is loaded to the player any active overlays were closed.\n- fix: dual audio torrent results\n  - The exact audio type will now be the highlighted best result instead of Dual Audio. Dual Audio will only be used as a fallback if the exact audio type isn't found.\n  - English Dub terms will now be properly filtered out if there is no English Dub for the series.\n  - Adds Chinese Audio term and preferred audio type.\n  - Fixes incorrectly detecting Chinese Dub as an English Dub.\n- fix: incorrectly detecting dual track as dual audio\n  - Dual Track typically doesn't refer to multiple audio tracks and causes accuracy issues if we assume it does.\n- fix: filter media title before term mapping\n  - Some media titles resulted in incorrect term mapping.\n  - Example: Synduality Noir was detected as Dual Audio because it has Dual in the title name. Filtering the titles out before mapping the terms results in higher accuracy.\n- fix: implement OAV filtering\n  - Fixes resolving series that include OAV in their title.\n- fix: detecting episode number in title\n- fix: modal overflow\n- fix: only child preview card\n- fix: duplicate genres in query\n- fix: description regex\n- chore: improve zero episode management\n  - Fixes edge cases with zero episodes affecting the file manager.\n  - Zero episodes will now be displayed, and allow the episode number to be changed.\n  - A series with more than 1 episode but the file is missing its episode number will automatically show the episode number as zero so it can be changed.\n  - Changing a series that has a zero episode will change the target file if it's a zero episode without modifying the others.\n- chore: offline improvements\n  - Allows for offline searches for already seen media.\n  - Hides missing media from recommendations and relations.\n  - Fixes errors being thrown, will now show the nothing found message.\n  - Improves the accuracy of offline detection, which prevents constantly spamming Cloudflare.\n  - Adds 404 images for missing banners, covers, episodes, and other icons.\n- chore: improve miniplayer\n  - Adds a border to the miniplayer to improve visibility.\n  - Fixed miniplayer scaling, the miniplayer now scales as a ratio to the size of the app window to prevent crowding.\n  - Fixes a lot of miscellaneous miniplayer bugs on Android.\n- chore: improve outage detection\n  - Fixes a majority of issues when the Anilist API is down. Functionality will now be similar to offline mode.\n  - You will be able to search, view, play, load torrents, resolve media, and view the schedule for any series you have previously \"seen\".\n  - Anything you haven't seen will be hidden and fail to resolve.\n- chore: rework following\n  - The following section has been removed, as it was taking up too much space for providing nearly zero info.\n  - User icons will be shown that when hovered or focused will show the user's profile and their current series stats.\n- chore: add safe area to cards\n  - Added a safe area to notification and file manager cards behind the buttons/inputs on the card itself to prevent unintentional clicks to the card itself on Android.\n- chore: hide fast forward and rewind\n  - Now properly hides these buttons when using an external player.\n- chore: add torrent button to episode list\n  - Each episode card in the episode list under the anime details will now show a quick preview icon of the torrent status. This helps quickly identify pre-downloaded episodes.\n- chore: fuzzy subtitle match\n  - Subtitles will be checked from the track name if not found in the track language.\n- chore: improve share and open buttons\n  - Adds individual MyAnimeList and Anilist buttons to click to share or alt-click to open the webpage.\n- chore: fix incorrect batch search\n  - Batch searches were returning cached results that didn't respect the Adult Content setting.\n- chore: hide focus elements\n- chore: better audio label order","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"6.2.0","site":"https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru","source":"RockinChaos","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
