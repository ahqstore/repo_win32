This was occurring due to new Android policies limiting the CPU usage on background apps.\n  - Removes the battery optimization permission requirement for external playback.\n- fix: wide cover images\n  - Fixes weird cover images that aren't a standard size, like Dr. STONE SCIENCE FUTURE Cour 2.\n- fix: Ooops! Dubbed Releases\n  - Would occasionally occur when the cache is reset or when it is unable to find the respective media in the cache.\n- fix: dub filter\n  - The Dub filter would break the user list search and was non-functional for general search.\n- fix: Android episode summary\n  - Fixes description being cut off and skeleton card showing extra lines that aren't shown.\n- fix: discord-rpc\n  - Fixes edge cases where rpc is shown when it shouldn't be.\n  - rpc now properly shows after Discord restarts or when swapping profiles.\n  - Fixes edge case where limited isn't respected until several seconds after startup.\n- fix: mapping rate limit\n  - Adds rate limiting to mappings so data is resolved and returned rather than outright failing. May slightly increase how long you see skeleton cards when hammering the api.\n- fix: duplicate torrent edge case\n- fix: hide availability warning when seeding\n- fix: showing broken image\n- chore: improve player to external player\n  - Heavily improves the external player functionality in relation to the built-in player. Functionality of the external player is triggered similarly to how the built-in player functions.\n  - External player now only appears when you click to play the video (or if auto-play is enabled in settings) instead of forcing the external player to open as soon as the video loads.\n  - Buttons that do not relate to the external player will now be hidden from the built-in player.\n- chore: improve schedule fetching\n  - Dub/Sub/Hentai Home sections and Sub/Dub schedules will now only be fetched when a change is detected. This improves how quickly you see changes to the schedule and episodes added to the feed.\n  - This heavily reduces data usage since checking for changes costs less than 1KB, whereas fetching the feeds constantly costs more than 1MB each interval.\n- chore: improve home sections\n  - Modifying the sections in the settings will automatically update the home page without requiring an app restart.\n  - If a section update is requested and the values are identical, the update will now be skipped.\n- chore: improve caching performance\n  - Caching has been heavily improved, now much more performant and properly batches writes for queries and media.\n- chore: reduce torrent cache hits\n  - Improves upon cache comparisons to reduce the number of times data is saved to the cache.\n- chore: improve bitfield caching\n- chore: reduce log size","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"6.1.12","site":"https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru","source":"RockinChaos","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
