This allows the app to accurately detect camera notches and position navigation elements correctly in landscape orientation.\n- fix: miniplayer position on settings page with active overlay\n- fix: batches incorrectly displayed as episode 0\n- fix: settings padding on Android\n- fix: episode number validation\n- chore: update deps","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.4.7","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru","source":"RockinChaos","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
