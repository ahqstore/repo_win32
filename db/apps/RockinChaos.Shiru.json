However, when the app was minimized to the system tray, this was not properly functioning, resulting in nothing happening.\n- fix: single instance lock\n  - If a second instance was created, the app would close but leave behind an abandoned process that continued running in the background.\n- fix: mappings fallback\n  - Kitsu went down, resulting in the episode list being completely missing instead of properly ignoring Kitsu as a source.\n- fix: deselect text\n  - Once text was selected, it was impossible to deselect. You can now properly deselect text by intuitively clicking outside the text area.\n- chore: caching performance improvements\n  - Improves the performance of caching once the existing cache has a large amount of data.\n- chore: catch Linux EPIPE pop-up\n  - Under certain circumstances an EPIPE error may appear on Linux due to the webtorrent worker losing connection to the player process.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"6.1.0","site":"https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru","source":"RockinChaos","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
