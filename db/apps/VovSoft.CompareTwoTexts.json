It's particularly useful for tasks such as code comparison, document revisions, and content analysis.\n\nOne of its key features is its ability to accurately detect and highlight differences between the compared texts. Additionally, the software can identify and display lines that are unique to each text file, helping users identify additions, deletions, or modifications between versions of a document or codebase.\n\nThis program offers customizable options to tailor the comparison process to specific needs. Users can choose to ignore whitespaces, ignore letter cases (uppercase/lowercase), even change comparison algorithm, ensuring accurate and meaningful comparisons. It supports loading plain text files (txt) and Microsoft Word documents (doc and docx).\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.3.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
