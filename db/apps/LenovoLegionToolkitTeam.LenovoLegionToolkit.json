State is preserved across mode changes.\n- Catch-Up Logic: When switching detection modes, already-running games are immediately recognized by the new mode.\n- Permission Hardening: Games running as Administrator are now detected even when LLT cannot read their full executable path.\n- Startup Stability: AI Controller initialization is now prioritized to ensure consistent system state before Automation triggers.\nAutomation Enhancements\n- Run on Startup Option: Pipelines can now be marked to automatically check and apply when the application starts.\n- Dangerous Step Protection: Steps that could cause issues on startup (Close App, Deactivate GPU, Hybrid Mode, Turn Off WiFi, Turn Off Monitors) are automatically skipped during startup execution.\n- Step Priority Warnings: Added UI warnings for conflicting automation steps (e.g., brightness changes overridden by power mode transitions OR adding a dangerous step).\n- Search and Filter: Added search/filter functionality to automation step and pipeline creation windows.\n- Startup Trigger Handling: Improved automation pipeline triggers to handle StartupAutomationEvent correctly.\n- OR Trigger Logic: Added support for OR conditions in automation pipeline triggers, allowing pipelines to run when any of multiple conditions are met.\n- Drag and Drop Reordering: Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for reordering automation steps and actions within pipelines.\n- Fan Max Speed Step: Added new automation step to control maximum fan speed settings.\nUser Configuration\n- Process Blacklist: Implemented a user-configurable process exclusion list for game detection.\n- Detection Mode UI: Added a Game Detection card on the Automation page with a dropdown for mode selection and an \"Excluded Processes\" button for managing the process blacklist.\n- Settings Page Redesign: Redesigned the settings page, organizing individual settings into appropriate categories.\nBug Fixes\n- Tray Tooltip Freeze Fix: Prevented UI thread blocking when hovering over the tray icon immediately after startup by implementing async factory pattern for StatusWindow.\n- State Transition Fix: Ensured \"Game Stopped\" events fire correctly when switching between detection modes.\n- Drag Handler Rewrite: Replaced and improved drag handlers to resolve inconsistent behavior and improve responsiveness.\n- Game Focus Handling: Fixed the Game Stop trigger firing incorrectly when a game loses focus.\n- Hybrid-Auto Battery Fix: Fixed an issue where, when using Hybrid-Auto, the dGPU wouldn't eject after a cold boot or restart while on battery.\n- GPUController Exception Refactor: Refactored exception handling in GPUController to use NVIDIAApiException for specific error codes, including improved NVAPI error handling.\n- dGPU Log Spam Fix: Fixed an issue where logs would spam after the dGPU was ejected.\n- dGPU P-State Persistence Fix: Fixed an issue that caused the dGPU to remain permanently in the P0/P8 states.\n- dGPU Minimized Wake Fix: Fixed an issue where the dGPU would wake up repeatedly when the application was minimized.\n- Autorun Task XML Fix: Fixed an issue where Task XML contains unexpected nodes in Autorun configuration.\n- Sensors Control NaN Fix: Fixed NaN is not a valid value for property Value in SensorsControlV2.\n- CCD Visibility Fix: Fixed an issue that prevents the CCD from being hidden if no active cores are present..\n- Windows 23H2 Crash Fix: Fixed an issue where Windows versions older than 23H2 would cause silent crash. Added Extreme mode to HasGodModeToOtherModeSwitchingBug.\n- Legacy Laptop Fixes: Fixed issues on legacy laptops where Dynamic Boost and GPU CTGP are affected by Max Offset. Fixed NotificationWindow showing in Taskbar. Fixed Advanced Overclocking option being available for Intel laptops.\n- Chinese Model Processing: Fixed an issue where Chinese model names were not correctly processed.\n- FloatingGadget Stability: Fixed an issue where FloatingGadget shutdown by accident would raise errors. Changed to subscribe to WMI events for improved stability.\n- AMD Overclocking Fix: Fixed index out of bounds error in AMD overclocking for single-CCD CPUs.\n- Fan Curve Save Fix: Fixed an issue where custom fan curves would not save correctly.\n- Frequency Desync Fix: Fixed an issue where CPU/GPU frequency readings would desynchronize.\nUI/UX Improvements\n- PBO Window Enhancement: Improved PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) Window with core index display for better visibility.\n- Drag and Drop UI: Implemented global drag-and-drop functionality for automation actions and steps.\n- UI Issue Fixes: Various UI consistency and visual bug fixes.\nHardware Support\n- LOQ Keyboard Support: Added support for LOQ series keyboard backlight control.\n- Generation Detection: Improved hardware generation detection for better compatibility.\nSystem Improvements\n- Logging System Update: Refactored logging system for better performance and maintainability.\n- Power Mode Sync: Changed Power Mode / Plan sync default to be enabled by default.\n- Localization Updates: Fixed missing localization strings and improved localization consistency.\n- Updater and CI Alignment: Switched to GitHub-only channel-based updates and aligned release and build workflows for stable, beta, and dev publishing.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.28.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/LenovoLegionToolkit-Team","source":"Bartosz Cichecki","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
