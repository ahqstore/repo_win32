Arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI provides a set analysis methods and parameter estimation.\nNew Features since COPASI 4.44 (Build 295)\n- Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n  - Added a new tool which attempts to convert ODEs into reactions.\n  - Added a menu entry which allows definition and subsequent execution of user defined tools.\n- Standards\n  - SBML Import added an option determining how to handle the import of initial values initial references.\nBug Fixes and Enhancements since COPASI 4.44 (Build 295)\n- Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n  - Optimization and Parameter Estimation: Whether to display the population dynamics is now part of the problem specification.\n  - Fixed deletion of plots in the plot overview.\n  - Fixed issue where event targets where not longer added to plots, reports, and time series.\n  - Fixed crash occurring when switching the plot engine to: Qt DataVizualization (surface) for non surface plots.\n  - Improved labels for surface plots which where limited to 2 decimal digits.\n  - Fixed problem with notes of global quantities occurring when copying.\n  - Time course Method Hybrid (RK-45): Selecting the partitioning strategy: user defined and selecting the deterministic reactions caused a crash.\n  - Fixed delay during start on some Windows 11 installations caused while saving the known MIRIAM resources.\n  - Functions: It is not longer permitted to copy mass action kinetics.\n  - Fixed crash occurring when repeatedly deleting parameter sets.\n  - Fixed problem deleting multiple global quantities.\n  - Fixed crash when deleting interdependent global quantities.\n- Command Line (CopasiSE)\n  - The argument to the option --report-file is now taken relative to the current working directory.\n  - Steady-State: Added warning message indicating that no steady-state was found.\n- Simulation Engine\n  - MCA: Fixed scaling for small compartment volumes.\n  - Steady-State: Fixed occasionally occurring problem calculating the target criterions for models containing moieties, which lead to not finding a steady-state.\n  - Events: Fixed crash caused by invalid trigger expression.\n  - Time Course: Fixed output of all steps when the duration is negative.\n  - Parameter Estimation: Non existing constraint objects will lead to a warning message.\n- Standards\n  - SED-ML: Improved import of time course option initial time and number of points.\n  - SBML: Improved import of reaction IDs used in multiple assignments.\n  - SBML: Improved import of files containing reaction kinetics with missing parameters.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"Build-298","site":"https://copasi.org/","source":"copasi.org","license_or_tos":"Artistic-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
