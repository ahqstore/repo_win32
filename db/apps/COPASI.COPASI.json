Arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI provides a set analysis methods and parameter estimation.\nBug Fixes\n- Command Line (CopasiSE)\n  - No files are created or modified when the option --validate is given.\n- Simulation Engine\n  - Time Course Task: The methods RADAU5 not correctly supports the option Suppress Output Before ...\n  - Time Course Task: The hybrid methods Hybrid LSODA & Hybrid Runge-Kutta now supports automatic step size correctly.\n  - Optimization and Parameter Estimation Tasks: The method Praxis now correctly terminates if the if solution is within the tolerance.\n  - Parameter Estimation Task: The Method Evolution Strategy (SRES) checks not the functional constraints like other methods.\n  - Metabolic Control Analysis and Linear Noise Approximation Tasks: The result now contains the Steady-State result.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.44.295","site":"https://copasi.org/","source":"copasi.org","license_or_tos":"Artistic-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
