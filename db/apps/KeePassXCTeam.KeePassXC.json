You can run KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. KeePassXC is for people with extremely high demands of secure personal data management. It saves many different types of information, such as usernames, passwords, URLs, attachments, and notes in an offline, encrypted file that can be stored in any location, including private and public cloud solutions. For easy identification and management, user-defined titles and icons can be specified for entries. In addition, entries are sorted into customizable groups. An integrated search function allows you to use advanced patterns to easily find any entry in your database. A customizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows you to create passwords with any combination of characters or easy to remember passphrases.\nCheck out our updated User Guide --> https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide\nChanges\n- Allow adjusting application font size [#11567]\n- Add Proton Pass importer [#11197]\n- Support KeePass2 TOTP settings [#11229]\n- Add New/Preview Entry Attachments dialog and functionality [#11637, #11699, #11650]\n- Add database name, color, and icon options for unlock view [#10819, #11725]\n- Show entry background color as column [#6798]\n- Use icons for password strength [#9844]\n- Add \"Group Full Path\" column in entry view [#10278]\n- Passphrase \"MIXED case\" Type [#11255]\n- Allow deleting extension plugin data from Browser Statistics [#11218]\n- Add --minimized option to keepassxc [#11693]\n- Implement T-CONV and T-REPLACE-RX entry placeholders [#11453]\n- Option to disable opening browser when URL field double-clicked [#11332]\n- Overhaul action states and add icons to toolbar [#11047]\n- Show character count in password generator dialog [#10940]\n- Add ability to expire entries from context menu [#8731]\n- Add copy field shortcuts to Auto-Type select dialog [#11518]\n- Passkeys: Add support for selecting group on creation [#11260]\n- Browser: Refactor Access Control Dialog [#9607]\n- Browser: Add support for URL wildcards and exact URL [#9835, #11752]\n- Browser: Allow groups to restrict by browser integration key [#9852]\n- CLI: Add -d dry-run shortcut to merge command [#11192]\n- CLI: HTML export [#11590]\n- macOS: Add option to disable database lock when switching user [#9707]\n- SSH Agent: Implement feature to clear all identities [#10649]\nFixes\n- Major enhancements to documentation [#11745, #10875]\n- Various UI and style fixes [#11535, #11672, #11511, #11445, #11426, #11273, #11455, #11321, #11594, #11539, #11351, #11354, #10748, #11602, #11303, #11291, #10091, #9417]\n- Various improvements to tags [#11676, #11652, #11625]\n- Reset splitter sizes on database unlock [#11014]\n- Remember sort order in Auto-type popup dialog [#9508]\n- Fix database password clearing when modifying key file / hardware key [#11001]\n- Fix issues with reloading and handling of externally modified db file [#10612]\n- Support passkeys with Bitwarden import [#11401]\n- Fix various quirks with CSV import [#11787]\n- Show Auto-Type select dialog even if window title is empty [#11603]\n- Refactor hardware key code to avoid deadlock [#11703, #10872]\n- Show a clear error if hardware key is found slots are not configured [#11609]\n- Fix signal/slot disconnect when opening import wizard [#11039]\n- Fix setting window title as modified [#11542]\n- Fix assert hit when viewing entry history [#11413]\n- Fix multiple crashes on Linux [#11513]\n- Fix backup file path time substitution [#10834]\n- Prevent long-running threads from deadlocking the program with only 1 CPU [#11155]\n- Hide the menubar when menus lose focus (if toggled off) [#11355, #11605]\n- CLI: Restore the original codepage on windows [#11470]\n- Passkeys: Various fixes [#10934, #10951]\n- Browser: Fix cancel with database unlock dialog [#11435]\n- Browser: Resolve references in Access Confirm dialog [#11055]\n- SSH Agent: Add timeout to streams to prevent deadlock [#11290]\n- macOS: Replace legacy code for screen recording permissions [#11428]\n- macOS: Implement Secure Input Mode [#11623]\n- macOS: Fix showing ambigious name in settings [#11373]\n- macOS: Fix copy-to-clipboard shortcut in entry preview widget [#10966]\n- Linux: Prevent multiple lock requests [#11306]\n- Snap: Prevent need for snap helper script to configure browser extension [#10924]\n- Windows: Detect outdated VC Redist with MSI installer [#11469]\n- Windows: Additional exclusion fields for clipboard [#11521]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.7.10","site":"https://keepassxc.org/","source":"KeePassXC Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
