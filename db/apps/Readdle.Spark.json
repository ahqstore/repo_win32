Focused. Email.\n\nFast, cross-platform email designed to filter out the noise - so you can focus on what's important.\nWe’ve made it easier to collaborate with your teammates — even if they’re not using Spark. Here’s what’s new:\n- Shared Accounts with Office 365 and Outlook: Now you can collaborate with your team using the accounts you already rely on.\n- Slack integration: Keep your teammates in the loop without leaving Spark. Share important emails as links with our Slack integration.\n- Plenty of under-the-hood fixes and improvements. They’re certainly smaller, but no less mighty.\nAs always, if you have any questions or feedback, reach out at support@sparkmailapp.com.\nP.S.
