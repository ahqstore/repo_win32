This includes improved filtering, sorting and searching capabilities, and a high-level overview of the versions of all bot instances in the cluster.\nUpdated Oracle Joining Support\nOracle compute instances are no longer required to have additional IAM permissions granted to them in order to join. Oracle join tokens now also allow restricting which instances may leverage a token to join.\nOther changes and improvements\n- Fixed an issue connections to MongoDB Atlas clusters fail if clusters use certs signed by Google Trust Services (GTS). #61324\n- Improved reverse tunnel dialing recovery from default route changes by 1min on average. #61319\n- Fixed an issue Postgres database cannot be accessed via Teleport Connect when per-session MFA is enabled and the role does not have wildcard db_names. #61299\n- Improved conflict detection of application public address and Teleport cluster addresses. #61290\n- Fixed AWS Roles Anywhere cli access when using per-session MFA. #61273\n- Fixed rare error in the authorized_keys secret scanner when running the Teleport agent on MacOS. #61268\n- Updated Go to v1.24.10. #61212\n- Terraform: teleport_bot resource now supports import, and follows the standard resource structure. #61201\n- Added support for tbot to teleport-update. #61198\n- Instrumented tbot to better support teleport-update. #61189\n- Improved error message of tsh when there is a certificate DNS SAN mismatch when connecting to Auth via Proxy. #61186\n- Improved error handling during desktop sessions that encounter unknown/invalid smartcard commands.
