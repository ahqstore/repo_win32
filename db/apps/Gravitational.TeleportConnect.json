The health check user name default is \"teleport-healthchecker\". #61942\n- Added support for templating secret_labels, and the {{.Labels}} template variable, to tbot's kubernetes/argo-cd output. #61876\nEnterprise:\n- Updated AWS Identity Center integration sign-in start URL format to support AWS GovCloud accounts.\n- Fix a potential race where Okta assignments may never be cleaned up if the Okta integration is down while the assignment expires.\n- Created a dedicated Access Automations feature page within the Web UI.\n- Entra ID directory reconciler now overwrites user accounts created by the referenced SAML Auth Connector.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"18.5.1","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Gravitational, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
