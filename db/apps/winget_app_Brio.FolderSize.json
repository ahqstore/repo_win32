The new window shows not only the size of files, but also the size of folders. It keeps track of which folders you view, and scans them in the background so you can see complete size of all files within the folder. It's very useful for cleaning up your disk. Once you get used to having that information available, a directory listing simply looks incomplete without it!\n- Added experimental Windows Vista/7/8 client.\n- Reduced CPU usage of background service by about 50%.\n- Fix leaked device handles.\n- Better handling of devices that don't support change notifications.\n- Don't log useless \"ReadDirectoryChanges internal buffer overflowed\" errors anymore.\n- Installer tweaks: Include proper icon, remove unused Change option, better file compression","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.6","site":"https://sourceforge.net/u/brio1337/","source":"Brio","license_or_tos":"GPL","resources":null,"verified":false}
