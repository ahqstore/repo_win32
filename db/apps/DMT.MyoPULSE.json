MyoPULSE 3 will include a new optimized User Interface and new features based on input from experienced researchers. A key benefit of MyoPULSE 3 is allowing users to easily create complex stimulation protocols. Modification of existing protocols is quickly and efficiently completed.\nResearchers can create a single stimulation protocol containing up to 50 different frequencies, voltages and/or stimulation widths. When writing extended protocols, users now have the ability to add or delete stimulation sections anywhere in the protocol.\nMyoPULSE 3 includes a progress bar that follows the protocol in real-time. Knowing exactly where you are during a long and complex stimulation protocol allows for easy tissue response confirmation.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1.13","version":0,"site":"https://www.dmt.dk/","source":"Danish Myo Technology","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
