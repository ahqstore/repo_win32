Program with user interface, allowing to calculate fluid properties with different concentrations, calculating friction and pressure drops in secondary side piping systems, and comparing different fluids.\n- SecCool Datafit. Program for adding new secondary refrigerants to the package\n- SecCool API. Two Windows 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs which can be used in your own programs, one DLL specifically for EES (Engineering Equation Solver, by F-Chart Software), and one general-purpose DLL.\nThe SecCool package is developed as part of the project DESIK (Energirigtig design og regulering af sekundærsiden på indirekte køleanlæg med naturlige kølemidler) financed by ELFORSK R&D (#334-001). The project period was from 2003-04-01 to 2005-12-31. Maintenance and hosting of the project since then has been done by IPU.\n- Bug fix for 64-bit version calculating at high Reynolds numbers","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.0.2.0","site":"https://www.ipu.dk/","source":"IPU","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
