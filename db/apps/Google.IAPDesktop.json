This is not an officially supported Google product.\n\n\nRelease 2.48 introduces several quality improvements and fixes, including the following:\n- SSH bracketed pasting: When pasting text to a terminal, IAP Desktop now uses bracketed pasting only if the text spans multiple lines. This fixes an issue where bracketed pasting broke the ability to paste passwords to a sudo password prompt.\n- More resilient handling of metadata-based SSH keys: When uploading an SSH public key to the metadata of a Google Cloud project that contains invalid or malformed keys, IAP Desktop now ignores those keys and appends your new key. Previously, IAP Desktop validated existing keys, which could cause the key upload to fail.\n- Remote Desktop: When connecting to the Remote Desktop of a VM fails, IAP Desktop now provides more detailed error information.\nIAP Desktop is developed and maintained by jpassing.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.48.1768","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iap-desktop","source":"Google Inc","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
