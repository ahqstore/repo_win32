This is not an officially supported Google product.\n\n\nRelease 2.47 introduces serveral improvements and fixes, including the following:\n- OS Login for workforce identity users: This version restores the ability for workforce identity users to use OS Login. This feature was available before, but recently broke due to a breaking change in the way the OS Login v1beta API supports certificate signing.\n- Hung SQL Server or HTTP connections: SQL Server or HTTP connections, when tunneled using IAP Desktop, could hang when attempting to perform larger downloads. (#1644)\n- Unintended re-opening of RDP sessions: Selecting a VM in the Project Explorer could, under certain circumstances re-open a previously closed remote desktop session.
