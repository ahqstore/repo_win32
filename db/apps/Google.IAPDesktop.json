This is not an officially supported Google product.\n\n\nRelease 2.46 introduces a number of incremental improvements:\n- Terminal copy/paste on click: You can now copy terminal output by selecting text and left-clicking the terminal. Similarly, you can use a right-click to copy the selected text and immediately paste it. The behavior is similar to what you might be used to from the Windows-builtin terminal.\n- Terminal scrolling: You can now use Ctrl+PageUp/Ctrl+PageDown to scroll the terminal. These new shortcuts are active by default, but you can disable them under Tools > Options > Terminal. (#1611)\n- Using microphones over RDP: When you connect to a Windows VM, you can now share your local microphone so that you can use it within the RDP session. Microphone sharing is disabled by default and you can enable it in the VM's connection settings.\nIn addition, the release includes several stability improvements and component updates.\nIAP Desktop is developed and brought to you by jpassing.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.46.1737","site":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iap-desktop","source":"Google Inc","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
