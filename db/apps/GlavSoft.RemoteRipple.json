It is used for accessing remote PCs from mobile and desktop, and it is free even for commercial use.\nNew Design and User Experience:\n- The user interface in viewer tabs has been redesigned to ensure consistency with MightyViewer (a tool you should definitely check out â€” it might be the perfect fit for your particular needs!).\n- The number of saved connections has increased from 10 to 100.\nNew Features:\n- Implemented multi-monitor support. Now you can choose a specific monitor in the viewer when the remote host has multiple monitors connected. This feature works when connected to TightVNC Server for Windows, starting with version 2.8.81.\n- Added desktop scaling.\n- Added an option to save VNC passwords.\n- Improved handling of authentication failures. The viewer now prompts for a password again if the previous password was incorrect.\n- Enabled editing of station names in the list of recent connections.\n- Made logging configurable.\nBug Fixes:\n- Fixed an issue where the Home tab failed to display on startup.\n- Fixed a keyboard issue with the Alt-Gr key in Spanish, French, and German keyboard layouts.\n- Fixed incorrect session saving when starting a connection from the address line.\n- Fixed a memory leak (a bug fix in the Remote Core SDK).\n- Port numbers can now be specified with a single colon, e.g., :5900, instead of requiring two colons (::5900).\n- Various minor improvements and bug fixes.\nOther Improvements:\n- Enhanced error handling and improved displaying of error messages.\n- Added links to the MightyViewer and Remote Core SDK websites from the Remote Ripple user interface.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.2.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://remoteripple.com/","source":"GlavSoft LLC.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
