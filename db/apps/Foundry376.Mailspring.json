Thank you!\n- On Windows, notifications could not appear because of an issue checking Windows \"Quiet Hours\" settings\n- Dragging and dropping file attachments to the composer or the signature editor resulted in a path error.\n- On Windows, you may need to install Language Packs for some languages to be available for spellcheck, and this no longer causes an error.\n- The RPM build no longer generate build_id links to prevent conflicts when installing multiple Electron apps.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.15.1","site":"https://www.getmailspring.com/","source":"Foundry 376, LLC","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
