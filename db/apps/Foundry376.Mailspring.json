(#2573)\n- Calendar events can now be edited and synced back to the server. Drag events to reschedule them, or double-click to edit details. (#2574)\n- Mailspring now supports one-click unsubscribe using email headers (RFC 2369/8058). When an email includes unsubscribe headers, a link appears to quickly unsubscribe. (#2576)\nBug Fixes:\n- Fixed a race condition in category pickers (folder/label selectors) that caused the search input to lock up. (#2580)\n- Fixed composer input lag where Enter and Backspace keys sometimes required multiple presses. (#2578)\n- Fixed Office365 OAuth authentication issues caused by an origin header. (#2579)\n- Fixed RSVP calendar event handling bugs and improved RFC 5546/6047 compliance. (#2575)\n- Add missing mailsync dependencies to the Linux packages. We now dynamically link against curl, etc. and need these to be listed as Requirements.\n- Improve reliability of iCloud accounts by disabling QRESYNC, which is known to be incorrectly implemented by iCloud. Note: I /think/ this will fix the long-standing disappearing messages issue, at the expense of slightly slower sync of non-inbox folders.\n- Fixed network error handling during CardDAV/CalDAV discovery.\n- Fixed HTTP 406 errors during CardDAV/CalDAV discovery on Yahoo accounts.\n- Fixed in-reply-to header parsing on iCloud accounts where spam messages contain garbage values.\n- Fixed Yandex account sync error handling.\nImprovements:\n- Screenshot Mode now supports non-Latin characters. (#2577) Thanks @cheack!\nDeveloper:\n- Added GitHub Actions checks that verify Linux artifacts (.deb, .rpm) install and run correctly on Ubuntu 22/24, Fedora 40/41/43, and Arch Linux.\n- Removed unused Grunt tasks and cleaned up the eslint task. (#2569)\n- Windows mailsync dependencies moved to vcpkg for OpenSSL 3.6, latest libcurl, iconv, libtidy, libxml2, and sasl2.\n- Added openSUSE Tumbleweed to mailsync CI tests.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.17.2","version":0,"site":"https://www.getmailspring.com/","source":"Foundry 376, LLC","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
