We've applied additional security patches, and the UI is faster than ever thanks to upstream improvements in Chromium. On Linux, Electron 39 also brings native support for Wayland.\nOn Windows, this release resolves longstanding issues with spellcheck and adds support for rich toast notifications with inline actions.\nThe \"infinite sync bug\" that impacted iCloud accounts has been fixed, and we reviewed and applied many other patches to Mailcore and libetpan to improve stability of email sync. The updates also add supprt for TLS Server Name Identification (SNI).\nBug Fixes:\n- On Windows, the Start Menu integration has been updated for Windows 11 and the \"default mail client\" option now links directly to Mailspring's page in Windows Settings.\n- On Windows, mailto: link handling no longer breaks due to a launch argument parsing issue.\n- On Windows, spellcheck now works correctly by using the DOM spellcheck attribute with typing debounce. (#2535)\n- On macOS, Mailspring can now correctly create and delete the LaunchAgent file for launch on startup. (#2509)\n- On Linux, the tray icon no longer shares an ID with other Electron apps. (#2529)\n- On Linux, native Wayland support is now enabled in the Snap package. (#2527)\n- The \"Message Clipped - Show All\" window no longer has encoding issues. (#2526)\n- \"Download All Attachments\" no longer incorrectly renames files with hyphen-number patterns. (#2531)\n- Additional safeguards have been added to attachment preview generation. (#2523)\nLocalization:\n- Hungarian is now a manually verified language!\n- Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation has been updated. (#2504, #2506)\nDeveloper:\n- Mailspring now uses Electron 39, Chromium 140, and Node.js 22 for improved performance and security.\n- Mac, Windows, and Linux builds are now managed entirely with Github Actions, and new Github Actions for mailsync verify that the Linux binary is portable and is able to resolve certificates and authenticate against IMAP, SMTP, and our web backend on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.\n- TypeScript has been upgraded from version 3 to version 5. (#2547)\n- React has been upgraded from 16.6.0 to 16.9.0. (#2545)\n- Windows builds now use GitHub Actions instead of AppVeyor. (#2524)\n- Many dependencies have been upgraded to address npm audit issues, including better-sqlite, uuid, ical.js, juice, lru-cache, snarkdown, and node-emoji.\nSync Improvements:\n- Fixed multiple memory leaks, race conditions, and potential deadlocks following an in-depth automated code review.\n- Fixed CardDAV to avoid re-discovering address books on every sync.\n- Fixed SMTP EHLO/HELO with IPv6 addresses on Linux.\n- Fixed handling of empty IMAP parts from Outlook.com servers.\n- SQLite has been upgraded to the latest version.\n- Fixed Windows build compatibility with strptime and timegm functions.\nCalendar Preview:\n- The Calendar preview now includes a full month view with day, week, and month navigation.\n- You can now search for events in the calendar.\n- Dragging calendar events will soon update their time, making it easier to reschedule items.\n- CalDAV sync now supports calendar colors, recurring events with exceptions, and smart rate limiting for 429 responses.\n- CalDAV now uses ctags to skip unnecessary syncs when calendars haven't changed.\n- Fixed CalDAV crashes on Gmail accounts when parsing privilege-set.\nNotes:\nIf you run into issues with the Main window not appearing on Linux after the upgrade, try disabling Wayland by launching Mailspring with mailspring --ozone-platform=x11. That flag is required in VMs and other environments without GPU acceleration.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.17.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.getmailspring.com/","source":"Foundry 376, LLC","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
