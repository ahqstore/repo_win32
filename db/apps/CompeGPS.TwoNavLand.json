You can also use existing routes to modify their paths according to your needs: cut the sections of the route that don't interest you, join parts of other routes, or extend them as far as you want\n- Get informed about the weather forecast while planning your route. Check the weather forecast for a specific location several days in advance or, if you prefer, consult specialized weather maps with information on precipitation, cloud cover, wind...\n- Enrich your routes with extra information on the most relevant points, whether they are maneuvers or points of interest.
