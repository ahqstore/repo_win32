When Chef Infra Client runs, it performs all of the steps required for bringing a node into the expected state, including:\n- Registering and authenticating the node with Chef Infra Server\n- Synchronizing cookbooks from the Chef Infra Server to the node\n- Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies\n- Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node based on recipes and attributes\n- Reporting summary information on the run to Chef Automate\nChef Infra Client authenticates with the Chef Infra Server using RSA public key-pairs each time a Chef Infra Client needs access to data that is stored on the Chef Infra Server. This prevents any node from accessing data that it shouldn’t and it ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the Chef Infra Server can be managed.\nSecurity\n- Updated REXML to 3.4.0 to address CVE-2024-49761. (#14823)\nImprovements\n- Updated Chef::Util::Powershell::PSCredential to avoid leaking credentials as plaintext in resources. (#14897)\n- Improved performance when fetching remote cookbooks using Chef::Cookbook::RemoteFileVendor. Thanks @dafyddcrosby! (#14829)\nResource improvements\n- In the apt_repository resource, we added the signed_by property.\n  If set to true and a key is supplied, apt_repository uses the key in the Signed-By option to verify the authenticity of packages. If set to a string, apt_repository passes it to the Signed-By option.\n  The default value is true.\n  Thanks @tmccombs! (#14131)\n- In the registry_key resource, we added the only_record_changes option, which suppresses the reporting of the current value of sibling values in a registry key. The default value is true. (#14883)\n- In the dnf_package resource, we fixed the :remove action in cases where a package is version locked. Previously, :remove would attempt to uninstall the package manager if the specified package is version locked. Thanks @vmagro! (#14821)\nLicensing\n- We updated the Chef licensing warning message with more information. (#14795)\nCompliance phase\n- Updated Chef Inspec to v5.22.72. (#14841)\n- The quiet attribute in Compliance Phase now correctly suppresses CLI output when set to true. (#14817)\nBug Fixes\n- We fixed an error where the Windows Chef Infra Client Habitat package stated that Microsoft Visual C++ is missing and is a required dependency. (#14906)\n- We fixed a licensing issue when running knife bootstrap in air-gapped environments. If a Chef Local Licensing Service or license isn't set, it would attempt to connect to Chef's licensing server and return an error instead of a warning. (#14777)\n- We fixed a \"No such file or directory\" error when Chef Infra Client is installed as a gem on Windows. (#14780)\nPackages\n- We no longer build packages for macOS 11 Big Sur. (#14782)\nDependency updates\n- Pinned mixlib-log to >= 2.0.3, <= 3.1.1. (#14905)\n- Updated Chef Zero to 15.0.17. (#14904)\n- Updated Chef Foundation to v3.2.15. (#14907)\n- Removed the RDoc pin for ~> 6.4.1 since Ruby 3.1.6 already has the updated version. (#14857)\n- Updated Train-WinRM to ~> 0.2.17. (#14842)\n- Limit ffi gem to be no later than 1.17.0.
