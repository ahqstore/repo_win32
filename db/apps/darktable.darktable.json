A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.\nThe Big Ones\nThe following is a summary of the main features added to darktable\n5.2. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual\nchanges (where available).\n- N/A\nUI/UX Improvements\n- Reset window position if it can't be placed at last used position on\n  any available monitor in a multi-monitor setup.\nPerformance Improvements\n- N/A\nOther Changes\n- Add busy cursor while generating a GPX track preview and a progress\n  bar while applying positions from a track to images.\nBug Fixes\n- Fixed translation of snapshot module's labels.\n- Expanded width of preference boxes Lua Options so that long input is visible.\n- Fixed compilation when OpenMP is disabled.\n- Fixed an OpenCL bug in rastermask module for non-raw images.\n- Fixed regression introduced in darktable 5.0 with inability to read\n  raw files from ancient (over two decades old) Canon cameras that\n  recorded raw files with .tiff extension.\n- Fixed the inability of external raster masks module to work in\n  Windows with PFM files that have Unicode characters in the file\n  name.\n- Fixed a bug in liquify OpenCL code leading to incorrect clamped\n  output.\n- Fix color equalizer picker not working in quick access panel.\n- Paletted TIFFs were read incorrectly by the main libtiff-based\n  loader, with loss of color information. We are now handing them over\n  to the GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick fallback loader (usually available\n  in official/distro builds) for correct reading.\n- The variable names for the metadata tags variables have been changed\n  to the full case sensitive tag name to avoid ambiguity.\n- Fixed inability to remove collections with ' in the name.\nLua\nAPI Version\n- API version is now 9.5.0\nNew Features\n- Added apply_sidecar to dt_lua_image_t so that a sidecar file can be loaded\n  and applied to an image in lighttable.\nBug Fixes\n- N/A\nAdd action support for Lua\n- N/A\nOther Lua changes\n- N/A\nNotes\n- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific\n  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For\n  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any\n  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the\n  export module's preference options.\n- Starting with release 4.8, macOS versions older than 13.5 are not\n  supported.\nChanged Dependencies\nMandatory\n- N/A\nOptional\n- N/A\nRawSpeed changes\n- OM Sytem OM-1 Mark II and OM-3 crop was updated for better handling\n  of high-resolution raws.\nCamera support, compared to 5.2.0\nBase Support\n- Nikon D200 (12bit-compressed)\n- Nikon D5300 (12bit-compressed)\n- Panasonic DC-GH7 (4:3)\n- Pentax K-r (PEF)\n- Samsung GX-1L\nWhite Balance Presets\n- Fujifilm GFX 100 model name fix\n- Nikon Z50_2\nNoise Profiles\n- Fujifilm GFX100S II\n- Panasonic DC-S5M2X\n- Pentax *ist D\nMissing Compression Mode Support\n- Apple ProRAW DNGs\n- CinemaDNG lossless (Blackmagic, some DJI, etc.) and lossy (Blackmagic)\n- DNG 1.7 using JPEG XL (Adobe enhanced, Samsung Expert RAW)\n- Fujifilm lossy RAFs\n- Nikon high efficiency NEFs\n- Phase One other than IIQ L\n- Sony downsized lossless ARWs (\"M\" for full-frame, \"S\" for full-frame & APS-C)\nSuspended Support\nSupport for the following cameras is suspended because no samples are available on https://raw.pixls.us:\n- Creo/Leaf Aptus 22(LF3779)/Hasselblad H1\n- Fujifilm IS-1\n- Kodak EasyShare Z980\n- Leaf Aptus-II 5(LI300059)/Mamiya 645 AFD\n- Leaf Credo 60\n- Leaf Credo 80\n- Olympus SP320\n- Phase One IQ250\n- ST Micro STV680\nTranslations\n- Czech\n- German\n- European Spanish\n- Finnish\n- French\n- Hungarian\n- Italian\n- Japanese\n- Korean\n- Dutch\n- Brazilian Portuguese\n- Russian\n- Slovenian\n- Albanian\n- Ukrainian\n- Chinese (Simplified)\n- Chinese (Traditional)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.2.1","site":"https://www.darktable.org/","source":"the darktable project","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
