WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.\nInitially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable.\nIt is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.5.3","site":"https://www.wireguard.com","source":"WireGuard LLC","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
