This type of noise is very common in images that have been digitized with a CR digitizer. The program uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), convolution low-pass filters in frequency domain or/and direct frequency deleting to eliminate the pattern noise.\n\nWith Sante FFT Imaging the user can delete the extra frequencies (stars and lines) of the pattern noise directly. After that, the pattern noise has eliminated from the image without losing the details (the high frequencies) of the image.\n\nEvaluate it in demo mode for 90 days.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4.4","site":"https://www.santesoft.com/","source":"Santesoft LTD","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
