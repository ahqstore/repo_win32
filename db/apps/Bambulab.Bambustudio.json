It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.\n\n\nFeatures\nRemote AMS drying support\nYou can now start AMS drying directly from Studio’s Device page for AMS 2 Pro and AMS HT.\n- Click the humidity button on the target AMS to open the control dialog to Start and Stop the drying feature.\n- You can now dry filament while printing, but the drying temperature will be lowered during printing.\n> ⚠ Minimum supported firmware version: 01.02.30.00（H2D）\n────────────┬────────────\nimage       │image\n────────────┴────────────\nOptimized prime tower strategy for PLA & PETG mixing print\nMixing PLA and PETG print is a common user scenario where one filament is used as support for the other one. We noticed that prime tower stability could be further improved under “low-adhesion” conditions. To address typical cases where bonding is difficult, we optimized the interface-layer temperature, extrusion, ironing, and flushing workflow:\n- Interface-layer temperature boost for better adhesion: Added a new parameter to increase the interface-layer temperature. -1 means boosting it to the material’s maximum printing temperature.\n- Extra pre-extrusion before printing the interface layer: Added new parameters for interface-layer pre-extrusion distance and length. Before printing the prime tower, the interface layer now performs a short pre-extrusion to build pressure and extend the extrusion path.\n- Improved ironing strategy: Ironing is no longer applied to the interface layer. Added a configurable ironing area parameter for non-interface layers to preserve better flow behavior (especially for PETG).\n- Reduced infill speed on the layer after the interface layer: By slowing down the infill of the next layer, the base becomes more stable, improving interface-layer adhesion.\n- Additional flushing for the interface layer: Added flushing actions for the interface layer. Studio will do nozzle wiping before flushing rather than after flushing, and print the prime tower directly, reducing extrusion volume fluctuations and improving layer height consistency. Added a new parameter for interface-layer flushing length.\n- Notch at the interface-layer starting point: Added a notch at the start of the interface layer to reduce extrusion pressure and prevent the nozzle from dragging due to an oversized blob.\n  With the above adjustments and validation tests, we confirmed this optimization effectively reduces prime tower collapse in scenarios such as PETG used as the support interface for PLA.\n> ⚠️ Note: The above parameters are only visible in Developer Mode.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n────────────┬────────────\nimage       │image\n────────────┴────────────\nIroning on the support interface\nIntroduce ironing capability for support interfaces. When printing without support materials, you can try this feature to achieve better support-surface quality. Thanks to @Noisyfox for the contribution.\n────────────┬────────────\nimage       │image\n────────────┴────────────\nNon-100% infill patterns for top/bottom surfaces\nTop and bottom surfaces now support non-100% infill patterns, enabling more visual styles and creative effects. Thanks to @Buildasaurus for the contribution.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\nStandard 3MF color parsing support\nAdded support for importing standard 3MF files with color information. After import, the workflow is similar to multi-color OBJ: select the color data to map and apply colors.\n> ℹ️ Colored standard 3MF files are supported by tools such as Fusion 360/Meshmixer/OpenSCAD. Please refer to their documentation or the official 3MF standard site(https://3mf.io/) for details.\n> ⚠ Note: Currently, only face color and vertex color data are supported. For texture-colored 3MF files, only face data will be imported.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\nMesh subdivision\nYou can now right-click a part and choose Subdivide Part to apply Loop subdivision with multiple iterations. This is useful for models with low original mesh resolution.\n> ⚠ Note:\n> 1. Only meshes without non-manifold edges are supported.\n> 2. Color attributes will be lost after subdivision. We recommend subdividing first, then painting and applying colors.\nScale to print volume\nRight-click a selected part to scale it up to the maximum size supported by the current print volume, while keeping axis proportions unchanged.\nAbort load/unload filament process\nStudio now supports stopping the filament Load / Unload operations.\n> ⚠ Note: Supported printers: A1/A1 mini/P1P/P1S. More models will be supported in future versions.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n2D Lattice infill\nAdded 2D Lattice infill, suitable for lightweight structures such as wings. It includes two angle parameters for adjusting infill direction. Thanks to @LoftedAero for the contribution.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\nConsistent Surface & Short Travel Acceleration (Experimental)\nTo reduce common VFA artifacts, we introduced two options (visible only in Developer Mode):\n- Consistent Surface: When enabled, the speed planner prioritizes reducing speeds in regions like infill first, and only reduces outer wall speed when necessary. This improves surface consistency, especially for glossy or silk filaments.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n────────────┬────────────\nimage       │image\n────────────┴────────────\n- Short Travel Acceleration: Adjust this parameter to apply a gentler, lower acceleration for short-distance moves on the outer wall, helping reduce artifacts caused by short-travel acceleration/deceleration. The current short travel acceleration is implemented as a global parameter, with a default value set to 250 mm/s².\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\nThanks to @lorenzofanchi and PrusaSlicer for their contributions.\n> ⚠ Note: These options are currently only available in Developer Mode.\nImprovements\n1. Introduced support for TPU printing with the H2D left extruder.\n> ⚠️ Note:\n> - Minimum supported firmware version: 01.02.30.00 (H2D)\n> - The left extruder currently supports only TPU filaments with a hardness rating of 90A or higher\n2. Added tungsten carbide nozzles , with support for H2D/H2S/H2C/P2S.\n> ⚠️ Minimum Required Firmware Versions:\n> - P2S: 01.01.01.00\n> - H2D: 01.02.30.00\n> - H2S: 01.01.30.00\n> - H2C: 01.01.00.00\n3. Added support for TPU High-Flow nozzles (which will be available in the store soon). The process parameter “Top surface flow ratio” is now split into separate settings for the left and right extruders.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n> ⚠️ Note:\n> - Minimum Required Firmware Version: H2D: 01.02.30.00\n> - When importing older dual extruders' 3MF files in which “Top Surface Flow Ratio” was modified, the adjusted value will be migrated only to the left extruder. The parameter for the right extruder must be reconfigured manually.\n4. Improved mapping interaction when sending a print: To reduce mapping ambiguity for multi-extruder setups, Studio now displays all AMS information when sending a print, making the mapping logic clearer. More mapping rules can be found on Bambu Wiki.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n5. Optimized hardness-check logic when sending a print: When filament hardness exceeds nozzle hardness, Studio will no longer block printing immediately, and a clearer warning will be shown.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n6. Improved auto-arrange results.\n────────────┬────────────\nimage       │image\n────────────┴────────────\n7. Added shortcut Ctrl + L to toggle Overhang View.\n8. Added Back/Refresh/Open in browser buttons for embedded MakerWorld and MakerLab pages.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n9. Added Select All on timelapse and model pages for storage devices, enabling easier batch deletion.\n────────────\nimage\n────────────\n10. Timelapse Photography Kit can now be enabled when no storage is inserted.\n11. Optimized default display order for filament presets.\n12. Updated preview images for Engineering Plates on X1/P1/A1.\n13. Improved wording for the remaining print time display.\nBug Fixes\n1.
