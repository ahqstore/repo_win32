Pick and choose objects to reuse in other models.\n- Reuse common objects across models. For example, conformed dimensions, standardized date dimensions, and common measures to be standardized across models.\n- Command-line execution for automation.\nALM Toolkit supports the Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) format to view semantic model metadata in a human-readable, YAML-like syntax. See the TMDL documentation page for more information.\nBuild with latest TOM client libs including fix for TMDL serialization showing variant data type","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.1.11","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Power BI ALM Toolkit","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
