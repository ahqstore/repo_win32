Pick and choose objects to reuse in other models.\n- Reuse common objects across models. For example, conformed dimensions, standardized date dimensions, and common measures to be standardized across models.\n- Command-line execution for automation.\nALM Toolkit supports the Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) format to view semantic model metadata in a human-readable, YAML-like syntax. See the TMDL documentation page for more information.\nFirst prod build (digitally signed) that supports\n- DAX UDFs\n- Now Desktop is officially hardened, removed restrictions for Desktop instance PBIX target\n- Includes fix for https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Services/issues/354\n- Includes fixes for https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Services/issues/343\n- Introduced Interactive Login option now that latest TOM client libs now support it.
