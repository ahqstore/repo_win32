HeavyLoad puts your workstation or server PC under a heavy load and lets you test whether they will still run reliably.\n\nHeavyLoad is a free Windows stress-testing tool that pushes your PC to its limits by maxing out CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, and network resources to test system stability, cooling, and reliability under extreme loads\n\nKey Features:\n- Multi-Component Testing: Simultaneously stresses CPUs (all cores), GPUs (via 3D rendering), RAM (physical/virtual memory allocation), disks (read/write tests), and networks.\n- Real-Time Monitoring: Graphs CPU usage, memory availability, disk space, and FPS during tests.\n- Customization: Adjust test intensity per component, set duration, and define free-space/memory thresholds.\n- \"Maximum Terror\" Button: One-click full-system stress test \n* HeavyLoad now also supports installation on ARM64 systems.\n* The CPU stress tests have been revised. Instead of the previous factorial calculations, a matrix calculation is now used. The new calculation generates a significantly higher CPU load, which enables more realistic stress tests.\n* The graphics card stress test has been improved so that a higher load is generated.\n* An error that could occur in rare cases during program startup has been fixed.\n* An error that could occur in rare cases during the graphics card stress test has been fixed.\n* Support for the outdated Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 operating systems has been discontinued.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.jam-software.com/","source":"JAM Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
