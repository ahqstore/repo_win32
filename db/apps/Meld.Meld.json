It is also useful for comparing changes captured by version control systems.\nMeld shows differences between two or three files (or two or three directories) and allows you to move content between them, or edit the files manually. Meld's focus is on helping developers compare and merge source files, and get a visual overview of changes in their favorite version control system.\nFixes:\n- Fix incorrect DLL paths in Windows build (Kai Willadsen)\n- Remove upstream deprecated 32-bit Windows build (Kai Willadsen)\n- Issues fixed: #824\nTranslations:\n- Daniel Rusek (cs)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.22.2","version":0,"site":"https://meldmerge.org/","source":"Kai Willadsen","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
