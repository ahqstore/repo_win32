When you're ready to vendor a set, we'll highlight the item pick order, which is great when you're pulling from messy tabs. Optionally, it can also manipulate your offline loot filter, so you can fully streamline your farm.\nEnhancements:\n- Removing the option to 'Select All' tabs from the selector and limiting users to only search 10 Stash Tabs at a time (for both query modes). This further reduces the chances for rate limits ahead of league launch.\n- Increase the size of the Set-by-Set optimized pick indicators for Normal and Premium tabs (Quad tabs are the same).\nBug Fixes:\n- Fixing incorrect Warning Message for Set Tracker Overlays.\n- Fixed crashes related to users hitting their Rate Limits.\n- Fixed crashes related to users who still had old leagues saved to their settings (this requires a one time soft-setting reset for your currently selected League and Stash Tabs).\n\n(GitHub Generated Release Notes)What's Changed\n- Develop <- Release/v3.25.1001 Release by @HiMarioLopez in #628\n- Develop <- Release/v3.25.1001 Release Cont. by @HiMarioLopez in #629\n- Main <- Develop: v3.25.1001 Release by @HiMarioLopez in #630\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ChaosRecipeEnhancer/ChaosRecipeEnhancer/compare/3.25.1000...3.25.1001","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.25.1001","site":"https://github.com/ChaosRecipeEnhancer/ChaosRecipeEnhancer","source":"CRE Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
