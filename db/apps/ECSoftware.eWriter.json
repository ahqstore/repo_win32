It allows you to package a complete HTML application (along with all included files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, image, etc.) into a single-file eBook. The built-in HTML-to-EXE converter creates executable Windows apps with eBook content included. This executable HTML app can be eBook, presentation, even a game, and more.\neWriter creates portable websites in a single compact Windows file with an integrated server and viewer. You don't need to make any changes to your site. You just point the eWriter program to the folder containing your HTML and other source files and it packs everything into the portable single-file version.\nThis file is a Windows EXE containing both your site and its own embedded web server and viewer. When the user opens the file the portable site works in exactly the same way that it would when accessed online in a web browser. All your navigation and links within the site are present. Links to external pages also work normally.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.6.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.helpandmanual.com/","source":"EC Software GmbH","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
