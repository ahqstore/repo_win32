Removed support for browsing the Texinfo versions of the documentation due to issues with recent Texinfo and Sphinx versions.\n- CHANGED: The diagrams tool directory and library dependency diagrams to always output the root directory and library nodes.\n- CHANGED: The logtalk_allure_report scripts to update the previous report while preserving the tests run history when the allure-report directory already exists.\n- ADDED: Support to the lgtdoc tool for converting XML documenting files to HTML 5 files.\n- IMPROVED: The debugger tool documentation on breakpoints.\n- FIXED: The lgtunit tool to correctly report the location of tests defined in included files.\n- FIXED: Removed redundant goal in the diagrams::all_files/0-1 predicates implementation.\n- FIXED: Removed redundant goal in the tools_doclet example.\n- FIXED: Removed redundant tests for the diagrams and lgtdoc tools while keeping the same code coverage.\nExamples\n- ADDED: Locked doors puzzle to the searching example.\n- UPDATED: The testing example tests so that the number of run/skipped tests is independent of the double_quotes flag standard values.\nTests\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto standard format/2-3 predicates from the PIP-0110 standardization work.\n- ADDED: Additional tests for unbounded integers when used as arguments to the format/2-3 predicates.\nInstallers and installation scripts\n- UPDATED: The Windows installation script to also detect ECLiPSe 7.2 versions.\n- FIXED: The Windows installer to support running in system context for deployment via enterprise management tools.\n- FIXED: The Windows installer to support the base installation (with /COMPONENTS=\"base\" without requiring a user documents folder.\nIDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support\n- UPDATED: The VSCode support to create debug data files that include the clause heads besides the source file name and line number.\n- UPDATED: The VSCode support for more compact display of tests coverage.\n- FIXED: The VSCode support use of the atomic_list_concat/2 predicate to work will all backends.\n- FIXED: The VSCode support for ECLiPSe file paths on Windows when finding the enclosing entity from a file position.\n- FIXED: Bug in the VSCode support where calls to a local predicate would not be found.\n- FIXED: The VSCode support handling of included files when looking for local predicate declarations, definitions, and references.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.97.0","version":0,"site":"https://logtalk.org/","source":"Logtalk.org","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
