Using the Installer: Download Stremio-5.0.20-x64.exe and run it.\n> ⏳ Note: Preferably use x64 as this improves player limits especially on high end system.

I’ve patched the obvious issues, but the original targets an Electron fork, so it isn’t fully compatible with the community Stremio app as this app is based on the offical Stremio app (WebView2).\n🌍 Web Changelog\n- Added a default Playbackspeed multiselect to the settings\n- Fixed settings color input not working (09.09.25)\n- Added latest Animejanai 3.2.0.
