It uses NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) to simulate thousands of photons simultaneously, making it one of the fastest and most accurate photon modeling tools.\nNew Features\n- [Feature] User-defined photon launch angle distribution (fangq/mcx\\#13)\n- [Feature] Simulate multiple sources in a single session (fangq/mcx\\#163)\n- [Feature] Per-voxel mua/mus/g/n format support (fangq/mcx\\#203)\n- [Critical bug fix] Fix double-multiplication of pattern launched weight, (fangq/mcx\\#212)\n- [Bug fix] Apply (fangq/mcx\\#41) like 2x-float-buffer for dref accumulation, fix (fangq/mcx\\#195)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"v2024.2","site":"https://mcx.space","source":"COTILab","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)","resources":null,"verified":false}
