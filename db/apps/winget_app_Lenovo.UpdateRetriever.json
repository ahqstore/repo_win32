The repository folder provides the storage for update packages. System Update or Thin Installer can be configured to search for update packages from the repository folder on a network share instead of searching the Lenovo Support site. With Update Retriever, one can manually initiate the search for update packages, or schedule an automatic search for new update packages at a specified time interval. This allows greater control of the updates that are available to managed devices.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.08.01.30","site":"https://www.lenovo.com","source":"Lenovo","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
