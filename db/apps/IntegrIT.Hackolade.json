Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Tech refresh of ElectronJS (v40.6.1), NodeJS (v24.13.1), Chromium (v144.0.7559.220), V8 engine (v14.4.258.25), and related modules\n- Polyglot Relationships: added optional display of relationship verbs and roles on Graph Diagram\n- PowerDesigner: added reverse-engineering of descriptions of single constraints (primary and unique key), when supported by the target\n- Excel: enhanced reverse-engineering for files generated from models themselves reverse-engineered from PowerDesigner\n- Tools > Options > Forward-Engineering: for relevant targets, added possibility to reference files for SQL script hooks\n- Workgroup: avoided infinite loop when GitHub CLI authentication first succeeded, then fails due to token removal\n- CosmosDB with Gremlin API, CosmosDB with Mongo API, CosmosDB with SQL API, Couchbase, DocumentDB, Elasticsearch, Firebase, Firestore, JSON, MarkLogic, MongoDB: enabled primary key (PK) support for nested attributes in document targets\n- BigQuery, CockroachDB, Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Redshift, SQLServer, Synapse, Teradata, YugabyteDB: added configurable SQL script hooks for injecting snippets before or after CREATE SCHEMA, TABLE, and VIEW statements\n- Oracle, PostgreSQL, Snowflake: simplified custom SQL script hook properties into text area (instead of block properties)\n- Oracle: enabled configurable SQL script hooks for injecting snippets in ALTER statements of delta model\n- Oracle: added support for annotations at user schema (pending Oracle's addition of this feature), Table, Column, View, and Index levels in Properties Pane, forward- and reverse-engineering","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.9.5","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
