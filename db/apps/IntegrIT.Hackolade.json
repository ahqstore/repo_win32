Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- ArchiMate: added support for forward-engineering of scalar custom properties at model and entity level in Open Exchange file format\n- ArchiMate: added support for forward-engineering of complex custom props and relationships in both ArchiMate and Open Exchange file formats\n- Custom properties: added ability to declare them for relationships in modelLevelConfig file\n- Display options: added support for composite unique keys constrains\n- Excel: added support for cross-repository references in forward-engineering and in reverse-engineering, whereby $ref path is exported as defined in the model instead of being converted to absolute path\n- Forward-engineering: adjusted compliance in generated JSON sample data, addressing boolean property types, additional properties, and handling of `oneOf` constraints\n- Object Browser: added highlight of selected relationship, for consistency with other objects\n- Reverse-engineering: enhanced performances by optimizing number of parallel workers for JSON data parsing based on available memory and CPU resources\n- Workgroup: added support for sub-groups in GitLab (cloud & server) across all features: Open From, Generate Shareable Link, Save To, and Remote References\n- Oracle: added support for removal of primary and unique key constraints in ALTER scripts\n- Oracle: added support for removal of comments in ALTER scripts\n- Oracle: added support for updating properties of datetime attributes in ALTER scripts\n- PostgreSQL: ensured that definition names (UDTs) with special characters (including forward slashes) are correctly resolved throughout DDL generation process","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.7.2","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
