Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- License: enabled offline validation for license keys when using Windows Remote Desktop (RDP)\n- Polyglot: added possibility to derive edge relationships into another Polyglot model\n- Polyglot added alternate key indexes in ERD entity box for referenced and derived entities\n- Collibra: added detection of pagination type for fetching configurations in Collibra\n- Collibra: improved relation type recognition during forward-engineering\n- Avro: added support for unresolved named type when the field references a record derived from Polyglot\n- Db2: enabled ALTER script in delta model\n- Db2: enabled feature to apply DDLs and ALTER scripts to instance\n- Db2: added support for reverse-engineering of constraints when specified separately\n- PostgreSQL: added CREATE VIEW statement in alter script of delta model\n- PostgreSQL: added support for comment on VIEW column in generated DDL\n- PostgreSQL: enhanced forward-engineering to escape special characters in comments using 'E' only when necessary\n- Snowflake: added extra logging and a default port value to the configuration to assist with browser redirection issues","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.8.5","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
