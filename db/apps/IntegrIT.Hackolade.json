Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Relationships: added possibility to configure in Tools > Options > General how business names are assembled when creating FK relationships via drag-and-drop\n- Command-Line Interface: added argument --pkAtTop to commands forwEng, forwEngAPI, forwEngXLSX\n- Diagram Objects pane: consolidated annotations and rectangles under a single symbols entry with sub-menu, plus a help icon lining to the documentation page\n- ERD/ERDV: added a placeholder in entity boxes to indicate, when display options are set hide attributes in favor of description, but description is empty\n- ERD/ERDV/Object Browser: added badge to visually indicate when an entity or attribute is deactivated\n- ERD/ERDV/Object Browser: added badge to visually indicate deviation when adding attributes in entities derived from polyglot\n- ERDV: ensured that layout remains unchanged when adding new entity via membership dialog\n- Excel: added update of container custom properties values during reverse-engineering\n- Excel: enhanced handling of numeric properties so that cleared numeric values in Excel are emptied in the model during reverse-engineering, when the model is derived from polyglot\n- Object Browser: added Symbols (currently: annotations and rectangles) in search results, and in search scope dropdown\n- PowerDesigner: added handling of geopoint attributes during reverse-engineering into Polyglot and other targets supporting that datatype; to allow array of coordinates\n- Collibra: added possibility to configure assetType mapping with custom Collibra IDs\n- Oracle: added reverse-engineering of additional table properties\n- PostgreSQL: added normalization of arrays of objects when deriving from Polyglot","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"8.4.4","site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
