Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Tech refresh of ElectronJS (v38.2.0), NodeJS (v22.19.0), Chromium (v140.0.7339.133), V8 (v14.0.365.4) and related modules, including fixes for excessive WindowServer GPU usage and high CPU usage with <input> tag on macOS Tahoe 26\n- Security: removed false positives in ReversingLabs evaluation scan of Windows installation package\n- Cloud providers: updated AWS, Azure, and GCP SDKs to latest\n- ERD Display Options: introduced clearer Tools > Options > Display parameters, toolbar dropdown toggles, and View menu\n- ERD Display Options: added new display options: show only foreign keys (FK) and unique keys (UK)\n- Faker: changed evaluation of FakerJS expressions to get rid of VM2 library\n- Workgroup: removed custom commit message for squash merges, allowing the git provider to generate commit messages based on repository settings\n- Collibra: added publishing of multi-select custom properties\n- Collibra: added publishing custom properties from custom tab\n- PostgreSQL: added fallback query to fetch table columns meta information without SELECT permission\n- Snowflake: added handling of tables created from SELECT statements during reverse-engineering\n- Synapse: enhanced reverse-engineering to tolerate missing square brackets in partitioning statements\n- Synapse: adapted connection screen to replace AAD (Azure Active Directory) by Azure Entra ID, plus replaced Axios with proxy fetch library","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.5.0","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
