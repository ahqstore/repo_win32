Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Desktop application: achieved 30% performance increase when opening application by migrating bundling\n- Linux: added SHA-256 checksum file in download S3 folder\n- ArchiMate: added support for forward-engineering of complex custom properties of derived modeling objects\n- Polyglot: added support for relationships custom color in Graph view\n- PowerDesigner: handled missing single primary keys during reverse-engineering of Physical Data Model files (pdm) when structure differs from previously encountered\n- PowerDesigner: added support for different format for cardinality during reverse-engineering of PDM files\n- References: added visible attribute level $ref property with path to a definition\n- References: allowed to create (also change, refresh, and open in a separate instance) a reference at attribute level via the $ref property in Properties Pane\n- Views: enhanced properties handling and rendering of attributes marked as Primary Keys in underlying table\n- XSD: improved handling of duplicated descriptions in Erwin XSD files\n- Oracle: corrected return type of view alter scripts function\n- Oracle: added support for named NOT NULL constraints in ALTER scripts","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.8.0","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
