Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- General: improve handling default path location of file picker to select a data model\n- Object Browser: ensured that relationships name color matches those in ERD and Graph Diagram\n- ERD: added name of oneOf choices in entity boxes and object browser\n- ERDVs: ensured that relationships line style from ERD is preserved when creating new ERDV\n- Persistence: added adapter to remove extraneous empty arrays of complex props\n- Avro: added support for unions with named types, with unique names for records, enums, and fixed types to better comply with Avro specs during forward-engineering\n- Avro: improved derivation of Polyglot supertype-subtype into oneOf in Avro, using inheritance names as oneOf choice names\n- Cassandra: added adjustment for handling partitioning keys\n- Delta Lake/Databricks: added adjustment for handling clustering keys\n- ScyllaDB: added adjustment for handling partitioning and clustering partition keys","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.8.2","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
