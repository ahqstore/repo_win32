Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- General: refactored default path location in file picker when selecting SSL/SSH certificates\n- Forward-engineering: improved handling of default path location in file picker when selecting target files\n- Reverse-engineering: improved handling of default path location in file picker when selecting data model\n- Avro: improved forward-engineering by generating type as reference for referenced records in union branches","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.8.3","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
