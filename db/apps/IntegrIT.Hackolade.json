Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Tech refresh of ElectronJS (v40.4.1), NodeJS (v24.13.0), Chromium (v144.0.7559.173), V8 engine (v14.4.258.24), and related modules\n- External references: added support for reverse-engineering of references to YAML Schema files\n- Polyglot Relationships: added optional display of relationship verbs and roles\n- PowerDesigner: enabled reverse-engineering of colors of containers, entities, and views for each package/ERDV\n- PowerDesigner: added reverse-engineering of descriptions of composite constraints (primary and unique key) and indexes\n- PowerDesigner: added handling of markdown special characters in descriptions during reverse-engineering\n- Collibra: added option to customize mapping to avoid using the Hackolade scope during forward-engineering\n- Cassandra, ScyllaDB: updated SDK libraries\n- Oracle, PostgreSQL, Snowflake: added configurable SQL script hooks for injecting snippets before or after CREATE SCHEMA, TABLE, and VIEW statements","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.9.4","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
