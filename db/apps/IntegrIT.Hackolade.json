Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- ERD: fixed minor error in entity color picker when color was unchanged\n- Db2: replaced query statement with environment variables during reverse-engineering, plus added query to log file\n- MongoDB: added aws4 library in public package to allow AWS IAM user authentication and credentials file\n- GraphQL: add type for entity during reverse-engineering from instance\n- GraphQL: refactored deviations indicators in Object Browser for higher performance\n- Snowflake: introduced flexibility in script generation for controlling constraints in CREATE scripts (3 choices: \"In CREATE statement\", \"In separate statement\" or \"Ignore\"), controllable from Tools > Options > Forward-Engineering parameters, plus from forward-engineering lower tab and via Tools > Forward-Engineer menu","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.5.4","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
