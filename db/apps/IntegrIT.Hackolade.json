Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Tech refresh of ElectronJS (v39.1.0), NodeJS (v22.21.1), Chromium (v140.0.7444.59), V8 (v14.2.231.14) and related modules\n- Compare & Merge: improved merging of ERDVs with conflicting names\n- ERD & ERDVs: enhanced performance of Undo actions\n- Polyglot: preserved physical properties in derived models while maintaining dependencies when converting model\n- PowerDesigner: improved reverse-engineering to handle single column references as arrays\n- Collibra: removed articulation rules from pre-defined assignments configuration in forward-engineering to comply with new validation rules at Collibra side\n- Snowflake: fine-tuned several details when applying script generation options\n- Synapse: introduced flexibility in script generation for controlling constraints in CREATE scripts (3 choices: \"In CREATE statement\", \"In separate statement\" or \"Ignore\"), controllable from Tools > Options > Forward-Engineering parameters, plus from forward-engineering lower tab and via Tools > Forward-Engineer menu\n- Teradata: improved handling of canceled reverse-engineering process, plus made host field required entry\n- Teradata: added handling of reverse-engineer aborting action","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.5.5","version":0,"site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
