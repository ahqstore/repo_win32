Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model for data-at-rest and data-in-motion, plus the documentation of that model. The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.\nThe software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies. It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-readable formats (DDLs, JSON Schema, Avro, Parquet, Protobuf, ...) as well as database instances, or human-readable formats such as HTML, Markdown, and PDF reports.\nInstead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort. A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework. In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.\n- Relationships: added technical name property with support for naming conventions\n- ERD: improved display of rectangle names when positioned at the top of a container\n- JSON Schema: mapped business names of view objects to title when technical name is present\n- Polyglot: preserved original graph view nodes layout when deriving into a graph target or into another polyglot model\n- Polyglot: added handling of relationships marked as polyglot-only when deriving\n- PowerDesigner: added support for database views\n- PowerDesigner: added disclaimer if source PDM indexes are not compatible with model target\n- PowerDesigner: added handling of tag <a:Mandatory> and mapped to required/not null in addition to already handled tag <a:Column.Mandatory>\n- Print Diagram: added attribute color coding in Hi-Res PDF\n- Workgroup: added segregation of local commits from remote commits in Review Changes screen in respectively Push and Pull screen\n- Workgroup: added support for Bitbucket Cloud connection via API tokens with scopes\n- Workgroup: added expiration date for Bitbucket Cloud deprecated connections with app password (June 9, 2026)\n- CockroachDB, CosmosDB-with-Gremlin-API, DeltaLake/Databricks, Glue, Hive, JanusGraph, MariaDB, Neo4j, Neptune, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, Tinkerpop, YugabyteDB-YSQL: added a technical name property with support for naming conventions\n- PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB: mapped empty index method to btree during reverse-engineering","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"8.4.2","site":"https://hackolade.com/","source":"Hackolade","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
