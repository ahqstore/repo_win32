The Human NIBP Systems are based on Finapres modules and allow switching between two fingers, permitting prolonged blood pressure measurements with minimal discomfort.\n- Fixed an issue where the Human NIBP enabler device scan could put certain other LCC Devices in an unrecoverable state.\n- Fixed a minor issue where the Human NIBP Nano would sometimes not be detected when launching LabChart, if there had been a serious device error prior.\nKnown Issues\nThere are no new known issues in this release.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.0.8400","version":0,"site":null,"source":"ADInstruments","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
