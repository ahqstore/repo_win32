When a new person joins they will also be\nsynchronised. Syncplay also includes text-based chat so you can discuss a video as you watch it (or you could use third-party Voice over\nIP software to talk over a video).\nBug fixes and maintenance:\n- Fix MPV socket getting created in CWD folder rand only create second pipe if manually specified using input-ipc-server per player argument (#675 fixes #674, by @notpeelz)\n- Add support for mpv installed from Microsoft store (#662 by @soredake)\nFix invalid string escapes (#677 by @notpeelz)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.7.3","site":"https://github.com/Syncplay?type=source","source":"Syncplay","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
