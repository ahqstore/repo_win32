Dorion only ever had one report of this happening, lol\n- Clicking a notification now focuses Dorion\n- Re-adds Windows 7 notification behaviour\n- Use shelter's new(ish) \"injector\" pattern, which should prevent some confusion\n    - This basically just means that Dorion plugins show up in the plugins list with an info icon stating \"This plugin is part of Dorion\"\n    - This also means Dorion settings show up slightly higher in the list\n- Rework a fair amount of notification behaviour\n- Many rsRPC fixes and improvements\n- Fix top bar when using light mode (#273 from @luximus-hunter)\n- Fix safemode\n- Fix window not remembering position (#272)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"6.4.0","site":"https://github.com/SpikeHD","source":"SpikeHD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
