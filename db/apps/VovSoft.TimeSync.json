We all know how precious every single moment of our time is, and we are all trying to make the most of it. Vovsoft Time Sync is a software utility that capitalizes on precisely this idea since it offers to inform you about the time in your timezone as well as make sure your Windows clock is flawed by no desynchronization.\n\nYou can use this auto time updater software and set time in Windows when your computer's CMOS battery is dead or missing.\n\nTime Sync is a minimalist app designed to check whether your Windows clock shows the correct time. The program can sync it with any supported NTP server (port 123), and all that is asked of you is that you click one single button.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
