Behind this change is CoreLibs v1.19, AdGuard’s filtering engine and technical core. Although not strictly tied to this release, we also have something worth celebrating: AdGuard is now available in the Microsoft Store, making installation more convenient and, we dare say, easier than ever.\nImproved userscript compatibility\nSome userscripts are designed to work on Single Page Applications (SPAs), such as YouTube. Until now, these scripts often failed to load correctly: if a user opened YouTube’s homepage first, the script wouldn’t inject, and it wouldn’t trigger when navigating to other pages where it was supposed to work. With this update, AdGuard fixes that limitation by ensuring such scripts are properly executed across SPA websites, making AdGuard even more flexible for advanced customization options. This enhancement also allows us to confidently recommend useful tools like the SponsorBlock userscript, which automatically skips sponsored segments in YouTube videos. To try it out:\n1. Go to https://mchangrh.github.io/sb.js/.\n2. Click Generate link.\n3. Copy the link that appears.\n4. Open AdGuard and go to Extensions → Add extension → Import from file or URL.\n5. Paste the copied link and confirm.\nAdGuard is now in the Microsoft Store\nYou can now download AdGuard directly from the Microsoft Store, making it quick and secure to install, update, and manage alongside your other apps. Subscriptions and payments are still handled directly through AdGuard’s website, ensuring flexibility and full control over your license. Product updates for builds downloaded from the Microsoft Store will work the same way as in the regular builds. In other words, the store version is simply a new distribution channel, and the update process remains unchanged.\nSupport for Comet browser\nWe’ve added full compatibility for Perplexity’s Comet browser. Now you can now enjoy the same reliable ad blocking and privacy protection in Comet as you do in other supported browsers.\nChangelog\nImprovements\n- Added Perplexity Comet to the list of supported browsers #5625\n- Added a warning when userscripts require modifying the CSP\nFixes\n- The option “Exclude Wi-Fi SSID from the DNS filtering” does not work #5535\n- Microsoft Recall is enabled by default on Windows 10 Pro 22H2 #5580\n- User rules counter appears at app’s launch #5558\n- Active tabs in the Filtering log are not visually highlighted in dark theme #5563\n- False “Error” status is shown during update check despite filters being updated successfully #5614\n- The filter version and the date information are not shown in Custom filters #5557\nDnsLibs (DNS filtering engine)\n- DnsLibs updated to v2.6.20 #5636\nCoreLibs (Filtering engine)\n- CoreLibs updated to v1.19.34\nImprovements\n- Added wildcard and regexp support to the $app modifier #1906\n- Added support for the ALPS extension #1987\nFixes\n- Content-type modifiers cannot be used with the $urltransform modifier #1978\n- XHR timeout with “immersivetranslate” userscript #2000\n- Filtering is disabled because it may affect websites’ performance #1994\n- Some extensions stopped working after updating to v2.17 #1993\n- $removeparam does not work in pair with $domain #1999\nScriptlets (JavaScript enhancement for filtering rules)\n- Scriptlets updated to v2.2.10\nImprovements\n- Added new scriptlet — trusted-replace-argument #405\n- Added support for uBO arguments for href-sanitizer #493\nFixes\n- prevent-element-src-loading — TrustedScriptURL is not defined in Firefox #514\n- trusted-replace-node-text — some quotes are incorrectly escaped #517\n- Scriptlets compilation error in Safari 15 due to unsupported regex #519\n- trusted-set-cookie-reload — infinite reload for constantly changing values #489","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.22.5225.0","version":0,"site":"https://adguard.com/","source":"Adguard Software Ltd","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
