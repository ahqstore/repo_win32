You can now enable box drawing to be done by Neovide instead of by the fonts. This eliminates gaps between characters. The feature is still experimental, and needs to be enabled separately, see https://neovide.dev/config-file.html?highlight=box#box-drawing\n2. The default cursor animation has been changed to feel more responsive. The front of the cursor now moves to the destination immediately, while the trail is animating. Many of the cursor effects have also been fixed. Furthermore, Neovide now supports multiple effects at the same time. Finally, the defaults for some of the effects have been changed.\n   To restore the feel of older Neovide versions, you can start by lowering neovide_cursor_trail_size (https://neovide.dev/configuration.html?highlight=trail#animation-trail-size) to 0.7 and then adjust that and https://neovide.dev/configuration.html?highlight=trail#animation-length to your liking.\n   We are also looking for feedback on theese new settings, so don't forget to share you favourite defaults here #3077!\nBreaking changes\n- feat!: rename and deprecate neovide_transparency to neovide_opacity by @fredizzimo in #3024\n- chore!: upgrade the Ubuntu runners to 22.04 by @fredizzimo in #3037\n  - This drops support for running the Neovide Appimage or binaries on older distributions.\n- feat!: low latency cursor animation by @fredizzimo in #3054\n  - feat!: more configurable cursor animation by @fredizzimo in #3061\n  - This changes the default cursor animation, but it can be changed, see the main description.\n- fix!: simplify and fix the launching of Neovim by @fredizzimo in #3045\n  - This bug will be present again #2060, but remain closed as won't fix due to the complexity of supporting it properly.
