Windows users benefit from an improved ARM installation experience and multiple fixes for inking, scrolling, text spacing, gestures, and startup behavior. This release also includes targeted macOS 26 (Tahoe) fixes and updates.\nNote\nIf you have a SMART Board 4000 or E70 display, see the release notes for SMART Ink for an important update.\n- Highlights\n  - Expanded language support: Added support for Croatian (Croatia).\n  - Usability improvements: You can now use swipe gestures to easily move between pages.\n  - Improved table options: The “Adjust size” option for tables has been restored in SMART Notebook. This feature, previously available in earlier versions, is now back to help you quickly resize tables with a single command.\n  - Importing Microsoft PowerPoint improvements: Added an option to import Microsoft PowerPoint files as images when importing them as editable objects fails.\n  - Bulk Flipchart file conversion: Use the new bulk file converter to simultaneously convert multiple Flipchart files to SMART Notebook files.\n  - Windows for ARM installations: Improved the installation experience on Windows for ARM devices. Although SMART Notebook isn’t officially supported on this platform, the installer now excludes incompatible components to prevent related setup errors. SMART Notebook then runs using Microsoft’s built-in emulation features.\n- Resolved issues\n  - Resolved an issue where starting SMART Notebook on Windows could open a Chromium browser window instead of SMART Notebook.\n  - Resolved an issue where navigating to the next page in a SMART Notebook file retained the previous page’s scroll position, ensuring each page now opens at the top by default.\n  - Resolved an issue where the eraser on pens for certain SMART display models (including the 6000, 7000, and 8000 series) did not erase content in SMART Notebook files.\n  - Resolved an issue where text spacing in SMART Notebook 25 appeared differently when opening pages created in earlier Notebook versions, ensuring tabbed and spaced text now maintains consistent positioning across versions.\n  - Resolved an issue where an error message could appear when adding a link to a cloned page.\n  - Resolved an issue on SMART Board 4000 series interactive displays and some third-party interactive displays where using the display’s pen or the Pens tool in SMART Notebook Plus could cause unexpected behavior, including ink color changes, shapes switching to inking while being drawn, or digital ink appearing as a selected object while writing.\n- Known incompatibilities\n  - Installing drivers for SMART Document Cameras 450, 330, and 280 causes an issue with current Windows security settings. To address this, these drivers are no longer installed by default and must be selected during installation so that only those who have these document cameras need to install the drivers that support them in Notebook.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"25.1.352.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.smarttech.com/","source":"SMART Technologies ULC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
