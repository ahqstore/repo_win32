It also allows you to create and manage superkeys, macros, and shortcuts.\n\n\nHi, Dygmates\nThis is a quick update to improve the new pop-up to restore your layers after a firmware update.\nWe've added a way to exit the pop-up if you encounter any issues restoring your backup. That way, you can reconnect your keyboard and restore the backup manually in preferences.\nScreenshot 2025-11-28 at 18 10 47\nWhat's New\n- Improve restore prompt dialog by @gonza2206 in #1080\nFull Changelog: v1.8.2...v1.8.3","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.8.3","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Dygmalab/Bazecor","source":"Dygma Lab S.L.","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
