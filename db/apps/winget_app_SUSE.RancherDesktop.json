Please install it separately following the Microsoft instructions before running the Rancher Desktop installer.\nFor administrative installs, please set the WSLINSTALLED property to 1 as before if suppressing the installer check is desired.\nWindows Networking fixes\nDowngraded gvisor-tap-vsock to v0.7.5 to resolve DNS failures observed in v0.8.1. This restores DNS resolution behind VPNs and fixes other name resolution issues.\nmacOS networking changes\nIt is now possible again to run Rancher Desktop while offline.\nDNS changes due to connecting or disconnecting from a VPN are propagated automatically and don't require an app restart.\nAppImage works again on Rocky 9 and others\nIn addition Ubuntu 24.04+ made some changes that make its default configuration incompatible with most AppImages containing Electron-based apps (they crash with a TRAP error). A workaround is to run the AppImage with the --no-sandbox --disable-gpu-sandbox options. Alternatively you can enable unprivileged user namespaces with\nsudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0\nUpdates to Bundled Utilities in 1.17.1\n- docker 27.4.1 → 27.5.0\n- docker-compose 2.32.1 → 2.32.4\n- helm 3.16.4 → 3.17.0\n- spin 3.1.1 → 3.1.2\n- spin-shim 0.17.0 → 0.18.0\n- trivy 0.58.1 → 0.58.2\nChangelog\nThe full version changelog, from v1.17.0, can be found using GitHub compare and the details of the release can be found in the v1.17.1 milestone.\nRelease notes for 1.17.0\nOpen WebUI extension\nRancher Desktop now includes the \"Open WebUI\" extension. If not already present, it will download and install Ollama on the host (to have access to the GPU) and it will also run Open WebUI and SearXNG in containers to make it easy to explore and experiment with different LLM models. Working with LLMs using Open WebUI has more information.\nRPM package works again on openSUSE\nopenSUSE made a change to QEMU that was incompatible with the RPM release of Rancher Desktop; the AppImage bundles its own copy of QEMU and was unaffected. Rancher Desktop 1.17.0 is compatible again with the version of QEMU used by the latest releases of openSUSE.\nQEMU and Apple M4\nApple's M4 CPU was not supported by QEMU in earlier releases of Rancher Desktop (VZ was unaffected). 1.17.0 ships with a version of QEMU that has been fixed to work with M4 CPUs.\nThe 1.15.0 release was supposed to be fully native for Apple Silicon, but it turned out that the applet to prompt for the sudo password was still Intel-only. Now Rosetta should really no longer be needed for Rancher Desktop.\nBundled k3s versions list\nRancher Desktop cannot start unless it has a list of available k3s versions. This has led to problems if the version list could not be determined at first start or after a factory reset. 1.17.0 bundles a k3s version list, which is up-to-date as of the release data of Rancher Desktop. As a result, the app will always have a list of available versions; it will only be potentially missing new versions released after 1.17.0 itself.\nNetworking improvements\nNetworking improvements have been made across all platforms, with updates to both upstream libraries and Rancher Desktop itself:\n- Enabled UDP Port Forwarding when a network tunnel is active (#6821).\n- Added support for the host network driver (--net=host) in both Docker and containerd engines (#7378).\n- Resolved Docker Compose network TCP (RST) issues (#7720).\n- Restored iptables scanning for Kubernetes ports in CNI-DN-* that were previously overlooked (#7722).\n- Addressed performance inefficiencies in the guestAgent process on Windows (#7763), (#7782), (#7825), (#7891), and (#7558).\nKnown Issues\nMSI installer does not install missing WSL on Windows 11 (#7975)\nThe Rancher Desktop install does not correctly process the latest output from the wsl --version command on Windows 11 and fails to install WSL2 if it is not already present. The workaround is to manually install WSL2 before installing Rancher Desktop.\nVZ emulation no longer works offline\nDue to a change in a networking dependency, it is no longer possible to run VMs using VZ emulation while offline. QEMU is unaffected. Stay with 1.16.0 if you require VZ mode to work while disconnected.\nspinkube operator has incompatible changes\nThe spinkube operator has been updated to version 0.4.0, which had incompatible API changes; it is likely that all applications using it need to be redeployed.\nDeprecations\nmacOS 12 Monterey and earlier are no longer supported\nApple usually only provides security updates for the last 3 major macOS releases. GitHub removes CI runners once the OS is no longer supported. Due to availability of hardware resources and software dependencies, we may be unable to create new Rancher Desktop releases compatible with older macOS versions.\nWhile Rancher Desktop 1.17.0 seems to work fine on macOS 12 Monterey, it should be considered unsupported.\nThe status of macOS 11 Big Sur is unknown, so auto-upgrade will not offer an upgrade to 1.17.0 on Big Sur or earlier.\nUpdates to Bundled Utilities\n- amazon-eco-credential-helper unchanged 0.9.0\n- docker 27.2.1 → 27.4.1\n- docker-buildx 0.17.1 → 0.19.3\n- docker-compose 2.29.5 → 2.32.1\n- docker-credential-helpers unchanged 0.8.2\n- helm 3.16.1 → 3.16.4\n- kuberlr unchanged 0.5.2\n- moby/buildkit 0.12.5 → 0.18.1\n- nerdctl 1.7.7 → 2.0.2\n- spin 2.7.0 → 3.1.1\n- spin-shim 0.15.1 → 0.17.0\n- spinkube 0.3.0 → 0.4.0\n- trivy 0.55.2 → 0.58.1\nConnect with the developers\n- The issue queue\n- Rancher Users Slack in the #rancher-desktop channel\nChangelog\nThe full version changelog, from v1.16.0, can be found using GitHub compare and the details of the release can be found in the v1.17.0 milestone.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.17.1","site":"https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop","source":"SUSE","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
