Pixelformer can help. Even if you prefer a sophisticated high-end image editor for creating graphics, Pixelformer would be a useful tool for doing fast edits, final tweaks, conversions, and optimizations.\nThird (and hopefully the final) Release Candidate (version 0.9.6.3 RC3) of Pixelformer is available. This version includes some last-minute optimizations and cleanups as well as fixes minor glitches found in previous versions.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.9.6.3 RC3","site":"https://www.qualibyte.com/","source":"Qualibyte Software","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
