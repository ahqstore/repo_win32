Every manufacturer has their own app, their own brand, their own style. If you want to mix and match devices, you end up with a ton of conflicting, functionally identical apps competing for your background resources. On top of that, these apps are proprietary and Windows-only. Some even require online accounts. What if there was a way to control all of your RGB devices from a single app, on both Windows and Linux, without any nonsense? That is what OpenRGB sets out to achieve. One app to rule them all.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.9.1244","version":0,"site":"https://openrgb.org/","source":"OpenRGB","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
