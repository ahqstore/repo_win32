It required however to inject a dll in every application and induced thus an obvious security risk. The amount of mess added to the code just for this feature was substantial and in addition forced to have both a 32bits and a 64bits version of the program running at the same time.\nThis version injects nothing into other applications. This means you do not have to worry whether you have a 32 or a 64bit operating system.\nAnother feature that was disabled is focus on typing, that was too much unusable for me to even start testing, so I removed it.\nOtherwise this has a much simpler source code, added a few extra options, such as transparent windows dragging, Maximize action, pause process options, more blacklists for finer control of AltSnap etc.\nHuman notes\n- You can disable the WinEvent notification when moving a window with NotifyWinEvent=0 in the [Advanced] section of the .ini file.\n- You can now add a [ToolTip] section in the Translation ini file to add tooltips to any option.\n- More work was offloaded to a worker thread reducing the risk for stuck buttons/keys.\nWhat's Changed (auto)\n- dni: Add syntax highlighting by @brian6932 in #571\n- Make NotifyWinEvent optional #572, #573\n- NotifyWinEvent only After Drag started #580\n- reafactor language struct definition #584\n- Add ToolTips to the config dialog #586\n- fix: ERRORs and add a quality of life for both sch_off and sch_on batch\n  scripts by @devCKVargas in #608\n- Fix typos and improve clarity in README.md by @jefflord in #594\n- fix: dni/ini diffs - attempt 2 by @brian6932 in #605\n- Update zh_TW translation. by @undecV in #587\n- Update German translation by @Ichisich\n- Add Turkish translation by @TRShadow33\n- Make Use of a worker thread #609\n- get rid of reduntant windows #611\nNew Contributors (auto)\n- @devCKVargas made their first contribution in #608\n- @jefflord made their first contribution in #594\n- @undecV made their first contribution in #587\nFull Changelog: 1.64...1.65","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.65","site":"https://github.com/RamonUnch","source":"Raymond Gillibert","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
