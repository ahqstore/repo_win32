RPC endpoint handling has been refined for smoother setup, with support for onion-service RPC interfaces.\nAdditionally, Wasabi no longer bundles bitcoind binaries, while block downloading has been simplified and made more dependable.\nüé® Refreshed UI with Icons & Animations\nThe interface has been given a polished update. Subtle animations and a balanced color scheme breathe new life into Wasabi‚Äôs design, making it both cleaner and less aggressive.\n‚öôÔ∏è Dedicated Config Files Per Network\nEach network Mainnet, Testnet4, and Regtest ‚Äî now has its own independent configuration file. Switching to test networks is easier and your preferences are always preserved.\nü§Ø Stronger & Smarter Coordinators\nCoordinators are automatically published as onion services right out of the box: no manual Tor setup needed. Coordinators can now also run on pruned nodes in blocksonly mode.\nPlus, fallback fee rate providers were implemented (mempool.space and blockstream.info), ensuring accurate fee estimates, even if your node can‚Äôt provide them.\nüõ†Ô∏è Refinements & Fixes\n- Full-RBF by default ‚Äì All transactions are treated as replaceable.\n- Resilient HTTP communication ‚Äì Smarter retry handling makes connections sturdier.\n- Seed recovery fixes ‚Äì Annoying typing issues are resolved.\n- Sharper fee estimations ‚Äì Precise decimal calculations with no rounding loss.\n- NBitcoin updated to 8.0.14 ‚Äì Latest Bitcoin protocol improvements included.\n- Clearer terminology ‚Äì ‚ÄúBackend‚Äù is now called ‚ÄúIndexer.‚Äù\n- Lean codebase ‚Äì Legacy components like TurboSync and BlockNotifier removed.\n- Safer Coinjoin handling ‚Äì Excluded Coins can only be changed when Coinjoin is paused.\n- Donation Button removed from Main Screen ‚Äì The button is gone, but donations are still possible via the search bar.\n- Conflux by default - Better Tor configuration for improved connectivity.\nInstallation Guide\nDownload the operating system relevant software package and install Wasabi like you would with any other software on your computer.\nFor a detailed installation guide, including signature verification, see the documentation.\nDocumentation\nüï∏Ô∏è Website\nüßÖ Tor onion site\nüìô Documentation\n‚ùî FAQ\nAdvanced Guide\nIf you want to build or update Wasabi from source code, check out these easy instructions.\nWasabi uses reproducible builds, which you can verify with this guide.\nRequirements\n- Windows 10 1607+\n- Windows 11 22000+\n- macOS 12.0+\n- Ubuntu 22.04+\n- Fedora 37+\n- Debian 11+\nWhat's Changed\nFeatures\n‚Ä¢ One config file per bitcoin network by @lontivero #13833\n‚Ä¢ Color revision & colorful check icons/animation by @Astakhin #13977, #14002\n‚Ä¢ Bitcoin RPC endpoint support by @lontivero #13922\n‚Ä¢ Publish Coordinator as Onion Service by @lontivero #14049\n‚Ä¢ Multiple networks support by @Ghost4903 #13952\n‚Ä¢ Make ExcludedCoinsFromCoinJoin optional by @lontivero #13925\n‚Ä¢ Show warning to restart Coinjoin after excluded coins change by @turbolay #14054\n‚Ä¢ Go full on Full-RBF by @lontivero #13965\n‚Ä¢ Support fee rates with decimal values by @lontivero #14035\n‚Ä¢ FeeRate provider fallback by @lontivero #14056\nBug Fixes\n‚Ä¢ Fix slow block download by @lontivero #13945\n‚Ä¢ Simplify & refactor block downloader service by @lontivero #13940\n‚Ä¢ Ignore block downloading errors other than cancellation by @lontivero #13931\n‚Ä¢ Remove Bitcoin Node dependency by @lontivero #13942\n‚Ä¢ Node disconnect handling by @lontivero #14030\n‚Ä¢ Rework Tor Network Checker by @adamPetho #13936\n‚Ä¢ Make HTTP communication more reliable by @lontivero #14013\n‚Ä¢ Fix Recovery words typing by @adamPetho #13905\n‚Ä¢ Fix Ready Icon by @lontivero #13949\n‚Ä¢ Fix announcer enable/disable switch by @lontivero #14052\nMisc\n‚Ä¢ Remove outdated documentation by @MarnixCroes #13895\n‚Ä¢ Backend ‚áí Indexer (UI) by @Ghost4903 #13963\n‚Ä¢ Hide backend status when connected to Node by @adamPetho #13962\n‚Ä¢ Remove Donation Button from MainWalletView by @turbolay #14053\n‚Ä¢ Update tooltip descriptions & quick tooltip improvements by @Kruwed, @turbolay #14060, #14062\n‚Ä¢ Remove ‚ÄúAdvanced Information‚Äù from UI by @Astakhin #14000\n‚Ä¢ Increase Primary Guards used & improve Conflux throughput by @turbolay #14023\nNew Contributors\n- @Astakhin made their first contribution in #13980\nFull Changelog: v2.6.0...v2.7.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.7.0","site":"https://github.com/WalletWasabi","source":"zkSNACKs","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
