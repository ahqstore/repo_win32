This change aligns with our long-term goal of completely removing dependence on the backend.\nAfter this release, Wasabi will be significantly closer to achieving that goal, with most basic wallet features functioning without an active backend connection. You can read more about the remaining steps on GitHub.\nüë®‚Äçüîß Quality of Life Features\nIn the last version, we introduced a donation button to gauge community interest in funding Wasabi's future. We have been overwhelmed by the support and interest shown by our community, including long-time users and privacy enthusiasts.\nWe want to thank you for believing in Wasabi and for your support, whether through using the software, providing feedback, contributing financially, or contributing to the open-source project in any form.\nTo show our gratitude, we've designed this release for you, our community. We've finally addressed some of the oldest bugs and feature requests that have been long-awaited!\nListing all the improvements would be too lengthy, but here are some examples:\n- Randomly skipping rounds was removed\n- Coinjoin settings & profiles are now all in a single tab\n- More information in the status icon\n- Resync button now available in Tools\n  And much more...\nWe expect these improvements to significantly enhance the overall experience of using Wasabi as your daily Bitcoin wallet. Take a tour or read the release details on GitHub to see all of them!\nüì¶ Backend and Coordinator packaged for Linux\nThe Debian package now includes two extra binaries: one for the backend (Wallet API) and one for the coordinator (Coinjoin API).\nThis makes it easier for community members to run a backend and/or a coordinator, private or publicly accessible, which lowers the barrier to contributing to the resiliency of Wasabi's infrastructure against potential attacks and technical failures.\nInstallation Guide\nDownload the operating system relevant software package and install Wasabi like you would with any other software on your computer.\nFor a detailed installation guide, including signature verification, see the documentation.\nDocumentation\nüï∏Ô∏è Website\nüßÖ Tor onion site\nüìô Documentation\n‚ùî FAQ\nAdvanced Guide\nIf you want to build or update Wasabi from source code, check out these easy instructions.\nWasabi uses reproducible builds, which you can verify with this guide.\nRequirements\n- Windows 10 1607+\n- Windows 11 22000+\n- macOS 12.0+\n- Ubuntu 22.04+\n- Fedora 37+\n- Debian 11+\nWhat's Changed\nFeatures\n- Use exchange rate provider selected by user by @lontivero in https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pull/13670659\n- Exchange Rate Provider UI Picker by @turbolay in #13696\n- Rework Coinjoin Profiles by @adamPetho in #13714\n- Separate coordinator from backend by @lontivero in #13653\n- Settings for Default Receive Script Type / Send Workflow by @turbolay in #13673\n- Smarter AnonScoreTarget in PrivateCoinJoinProfile by @turbolay in #13655\n- Resync button + layout adjustments in Tools by @turbolay in #13699\n- Remove random CJ round skipping by @adamPetho in #13657\n- Verify that our own inputs are in the list of CJ inputs before Amount Decomposition by @adamPetho in #13658\n- Replace ConsolidationWarning by critical LargePercentSpentWarning by @turbolay in #13671\n- Lower MaximumDifferenceTolerance to 15% in PrivacySuggestionsModel by @turbolay in #13666\n- Reduce auto-start delay + disable it by default by @turbolay in https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pull/13702l/13700\n- Bitcoin-friendly progress in loading screen by @turbolay in #13703\n- Set change script type by @turbolay in #13718\n- [UI] Finishing touches on settings by @yahiheb in #13697\n- Fee Rate & Blockchain Tip in HealthMonitor by @turbolay in #13735\n- Use mining fee rate provider selected by user by @lontivero in #13672\n- Reset all settings to default button by @turbolay in #13669\n- Allow to select 2 more inputs with BnB by @yahiheb in #13358\n- [UI] settings: add tooltip to backend URI box by @MarnixCroes in #13668\n- Button to Release Highlights in AboutViewModel by @turbolay in #13656\nMiscelleanous\n- Change default RegTestCoordinatorUri to match new Coordinator default by @turbolay in #13660\n- remove BAButton leftovers by @MarnixCroes in #13649\n- Test TweakKey and Signature correctness by @lontivero in #13650\n- Remove ShopWare (BuyAnything) files by @adamPetho in #13\n- Remove default logging from Coordinator by @turbolay in #13664\n- [UI] Remove Tor setting from the searchbar by @yahiheb in https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pul\n- [Trivial] Remove block hash from Transaction details dialog by @yahiheb in #13457\n- [Unwanted] Remove wallet backups by @adamPetho in #13711\n- [Trivial] Add newer user agents and remove some old ones by @yahiheb in #13720\nFull Changelog: v2.4.0...v2.5.1","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.5.1","site":"https://github.com/WalletWasabi","source":"zkSNACKs","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
