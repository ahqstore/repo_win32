You can control your system lights (including hardware and software effects such as system parameters monitoring, ambient lights, sound haptic), fans, temperatures, power settings, and a lot more.\nImportant! If you are using tools for the first time, please read Beginner's guide and AlienFX-GUI readme to configure out its concept and operation principle.\n#̶#̶#̶ ̶F̶a̶n̶-̶S̶D̶K̶_̶V̶1̶.̶z̶i̶p̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶b̶i̶n̶a̶r̶i̶e̶s̶ ̶b̶u̶i̶l̶t̶ ̶a̶g̶a̶i̶n̶s̶t̶ ̶o̶l̶d̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶a̶n̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶r̶o̶l̶ ̶v̶e̶r̶s̶i̶o̶n̶,̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶n̶l̶y̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶c̶a̶s̶e̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶k̶n̶o̶w̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶'̶r̶e̶ ̶d̶o̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶(̶o̶r̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶A̶u̶r̶o̶r̶a̶ ̶R̶7̶)̶,̶ ̶c̶h̶e̶c̶k̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶d̶m̶e̶ ̶f̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶i̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶ ̶a̶r̶c̶h̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶f̶i̶r̶s̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶f̶i̶g̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶i̶n̶g̶!̶\nI was forced by M$ to switch from VS2019 to VS2026. And I have 2 pieces of bad news: first, all tools become bigger in size (+10-30kb, D-Degradation), second, WDK doesn't work correctly with VS2026 yet, so I can't provide APIv1 releases anymore. I hope it's for a while.\nChanges in this release:\nAll light-control tools:\n- APIv8 (external keyboards) tuned to avoid flickering after massive light update.\nAlienFX-GUI:\n- New: Lock screen can be added as a profile trigger, so you can set the profile to activate at the lock screen:\n  - Button \"Add lock\" added into \"Profile\" tab. After pressing, Lock App (it's virtual in Windows) will be added into the trigger app list.\n  - You can remove it from the list like any other trigger application.\n  - I only check this for Windows 11, it may (or may not) work with Windows 10.\n- Light processing logic rebuild to avoid thread hang in deadlock, this also reduces CPU consumption.\n- Bug fixed: Application crash if \"Accent\" checkbox is clicked at \"Colors\" tab, but no action is selected.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"9.4.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/T-Troll","source":"T-Troll","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
