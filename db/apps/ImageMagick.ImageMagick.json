It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and Ultra HDR.\nImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.\nImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.\nMerged\n- JPEG: Support 2-to-16-bit lossless JPEG images with libjpeg-turbo 3.1+; Support additional IDCT scaling factors with libjpeg-turbo and libjpeg v7+ #8445\n- Add ALImageMagick (Delphi) to the list of ImageMagick language bindings #8444\n- Update Doc #8442\nCommits\n- beta release a5ad8fb\n- https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/8410 5735e8c\n- Bumped versions of download and upload artifacts actions. ab36309\n- https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/8416 e8c31c9\n- Move writing of the IDAT chunk to the end to silence a warning in exiftool (#8400) fe6925d\n- https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/8422 d0b07ac\n- Minor refactor. 47a94a3\n- Only use output values from environment variables. aa13999\n- Changed indentation. dcd54a5\n- Pin actions. 6cf8cfc\n- Changed indentation. 1beebc9\n- No longer persist credentials on checkout. 44525f4\n- Added cooldown to dependabot.yml 9d6611b\n- No longer persist credentials on checkout. 62357f9\n- Also pin the version of the msys2 action. 6d4f89d\n- Removed duplicate eof check. d356c51\n- Added custom end of file check to the pnm encoder to allow a missing final newline (#8425) 7404bd0\n- Updated the Windows dependencies. 72c1050\n- Close temporary file to make sure it can be opened again (#8420) be66a21\n- latest autoconf/automake updates 81eb8eb\n- Use the colorspace when writing images that have a color map in the pnm coder (#8429). 2a9f7c6\n- Use if statements instead. 389238f\n- Allow reading old Quickdraw PICT files that directly start with the size of the image (#8381). 9002a93\n- Clone the correct repositories for the release. 77a2c99\n- Improved the jpeg coder by calculating the range only once instead of every pixel channel. 602c436\n- Updated the Windows dependencies. 9c0546a\n- Correct incorrect free (GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m) 6f81eb1\n- Removed incorrect format specifier. a5ac3c1\n- Switch to cmake with the oss-fuzz build of libde265. cf149f5\n- Correct parsing of the density (#8460) f46647c\n- Added Visual Studio 2026. 67f7f33\n- enable coder policy \"write\" rights for MVG coder 85c04c1\n- Silence macos warning. a70f4b8\n- Disabling a module will now also disable all the coders in that module. 061b7b2\n- Updated the Windows dependencies. 5cff2fc\n- release a90c050","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.1.2.9","version":0,"site":"https://imagemagick.org/","source":"ImageMagick Studio LLC","license_or_tos":"ImageMagick","resources":null,"verified":false}
