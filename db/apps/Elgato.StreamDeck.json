All while focusing on what matters most your audience. As a broadcaster that likes to produce on the fly and have high quality production.\n\n\nWhat’s new in Stream Deck 7.1.1?\ni\nIf the update fails to install, please download it from http://elgato.com/download.\n\n🔎 In-App Marketplace Search\nPlugins enable new and powerful features for your Stream Deck, and we want to make the experience of finding and quickly using them easier. In Stream Deck 7.1, you can now browse recommended plugins and search for plugins right inside the action list.\nOnce you’re signed in with your Marketplace account, installing plugins takes just one click.\n\n🖼️ Refreshed Desktop Icon\nWe’re updating icons across all Elgato apps, and Stream Deck now refined look with color on both Windows and macOS.\n\n💾 Profiles save more resources\nProfiles in Stream Deck are incredibly powerful, making it easy to share complete configurations. However, they’re limited to sharing just the icon and key layout. With Stream Deck 7.0, profiles now tell you which plugins you’ll need when importing a profile, and you can install them with one click. Further improving the workflow, profiles exported with Stream Deck 7.1 now include files such as music that have been configured in an action.\nMakers, your plugin can now contain custom resources which are included in profiles exported with Stream Deck 7.1. Learn more in our Maker Docs.\n\n⛔ Disable Stream Deck Devices\nStream Deck devices can now be disabled in the Stream Deck app. This enables third-party software, such as Bitfocus Buttons and other applications, to communicate directly with Stream Deck devices. At the same time, the Stream Deck app can now remain open to support other Stream Deck hardware, Virtual Stream Deck or Stream Deck Mobile.\nYou’ll find the option in Preferences > Devices > Enabled (Yes/No)\n\n🔁 NodeJS Sideloading\nDevelopers, this one's for you. Stream Deck now automatically downloads and updates only the specific Node.js versions needed by your plugins—reducing the app’s size and ensuring you always have the right tools for your plugins. The version of Node.js required can be configured in your plugin’s manifest file.\n\nImprovements & bug fixes\n- The Volume Controller plugin is no longer bundled by default. When setting up Stream Deck for the first time, the default profile will notify that the plugin is missing, and you can optionally install it, or not.\n- Stream Deck Network Dock firmware can now be updated via the Stream Deck app.\n- Improvements were made to Smart Profiles and switching when games are running in Borderless Windowed mode. If Smart Profiles do not detect a game you are playing, please get in touch with our support team so we can collect more information.\n- Improved macOS 26 compatibility, and progress bars now appear again, for example, when downloading an update.\n- Resolved a bug that was preventing profile importing\n- Resolved a bug that could cause a crash when importing a profile\n- When switching between pages with many Open Application actions, Stream Deck will no longer temporarily freeze\n- Fixed a bug where installing Stream Deck would stop due to a missing MSVCP140.dll file.\nWant to share feedback on Stream Deck 7.1.1?
