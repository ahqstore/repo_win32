You can run KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. KeePassXC is for people with extremely high demands of secure personal data management. It saves many different types of information, such as usernames, passwords, URLs, attachments, and notes in an offline, encrypted file that can be stored in any location, including private and public cloud solutions. For easy identification and management, user-defined titles and icons can be specified for entries. In addition, entries are sorted into customizable groups. An integrated search function allows you to use advanced patterns to easily find any entry in your database. A customizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows you to create passwords with any combination of characters or easy to remember passphrases.\nChanges\n- Passkeys: Ability to easily remove a passkey from an entry [#10777]\n- Snap: Use new desktop portal for native messaging integration [#10906]\nFixes\n- Improve entry placeholder/reference feature [#10846]\n- Improve CSV importing when title field isn't specified [#10843]\n- Improve encrypted Bitwarden importing [#10800]\n- Improve database settings UX [#10821]\n- Improve handling of clipboard actions from entry preview [#10810]\n- Improve group/entry view resize behavior and set sensible defaults [#10641]\n- Passkeys: Fix incorrect username fill [#10874]\n- Passkeys: Return additional data to the extension [#10857]\n- Fix password clear timer inconsistency on unlock view [#10708]\n- Fix portability check [#10760]\n- Fix page overflow on HTML exports [#10735]\n- Fix broken builds when using system provided zxcvbn [#10717]\n- Fix copy password button when text is selected [#10853]\n- Fix tab ordering on application settings pages [#10907]\n- SSH Agent: Fix broken decrypt button [#10638]\n- Windows: Fix ALT Auto-Type modifier [#10795]\n- Windows: Fix wrong DACL memory size allocation [#10712]\n- macOS: Fix monospace font sizing [#10739]\n- Flatpak: Fix configuration settings off-by-one error [#10688]\n- BSD: Fix compiling with libusb implementation [#10736]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.7.9","site":"https://keepassxc.org/","source":"KeePassXC Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
