It can monitor and detect events occurring within your directories.\n\nThis folder monitor software can keep an eye on a folder of your choosing and track all the modifications that may occur, then export the log for further analysis.\n\nThe software will watch for file and folder changes, deletions, modifications, new files in real-time. Any changes made by users or processes can be detected. You can export the logs into TXT or CSV files, so you can save and analyze them at a later time.\n\nThis watch directory software is an intuitive utility that makes it easy for you to quickly track the activity that might occur in a folder or a network share. The entire workflow is pretty straightforward: you launch the app, choose the folder you are interested in, then allow the app to start monitoring it.\n\nThis application enables users to specify \"Include Patterns\" and \"Exclude Patterns\" through file masks. For instance, you can include .txt files by using *.txt or exclude .mp3 and .wav files by employing .mp3;.wav.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.1.0.0","site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
