It is designed with a home user in mind. You don't need to have any special knowledge of disk recovery.\n\nThe \"Recycle Bin\" icon on your Windows desktop allows you to recover deleted files. Unfortunately, there are many possible situations when the Recycle Bin is useless. Just a few examples:\n- A disk volume containing valuable info was damaged due to a system malfunction\n- A disk volume was damaged due by a dangerous virus\n- Windows cannot access a disk drive\n- Disk was damaged\n- You have mistakenly formatted a disk volume\n- Files or folders are not readable\n- Corrupt or damaged partition table.\n\nNTFS Recovery can do thorough searches for a wide range of file formats:\n- Presentations and documents (PPT, PPTX, RTF, PDF, DOC, DOCX)\n- Tables and charts (XLS, XLSX)\n- Archived data\n- Photos, images, and pictures (GIF, JPEG, PNG, PSD)\n- Videos as well as music (MPG, MP3, AVI, DAT, MKV).\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.18.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.diskinternals.com/","source":"DiskInternals Research","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
