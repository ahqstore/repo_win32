The SQL queries and statements can be run on Invantive Query Tool and easily re-used across all Invantive UniversalSQL-based products on Windows, MacOS, Linux and web. Invantive PSQL adds procedural options and Invantive Script makes it easy to export data and documents. Invantive Query Tool scales from small to large enterprises through the solid foundation on Invantive UniversalSQL, including many complex data filters, and transparant parallel execution using high-performance streaming of data for SQL queries. Multiple relational databases and multiple cloud data sources can be accessed in real time by a single SQL query thanks to Invantive's virtual database globally spanning cloud data sources and multiple databases. Loading a data warehouse for business intelligence is largely simplified by the integrated 'synchronize' statement, bulk loaders and the `union distinct` capability. To export data, Invantive UniversalSQL provides supporting native support for popular data export formats such as XML, JSON and CSV. Additionally, Invantive Script provides many more export formats. The graphical SQL editor integrates code editing, high-performance display of many data types, PDFs and images, data export options, data model browser and output browser. The SQL editor can execute single statements or run SQL-statements as a large batch of SQL and PSQL statements, real time exchanging data between multiple sources, mail and the local file system.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"25.0.157","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Invantive Software B.V.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
