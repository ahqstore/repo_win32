This extension also generates a flow-volume plot and spirometry reports.\n\n\nTwo new settings can now be changed in the Spirometry settings dialog:\n- Users can select flow units which can be selected as either uL/s, mL/s or L/s.  This is useful for work with smaller animals.\n- Users can now apply a noise floor clamp to the selected flow channel that can be used to remove small positive or negative offsets in the flow signal.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.5.3400","site":null,"source":"ADInstruments","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
