If a download takes more than 30 seconds, a TraySlider will periodically appear with the percentage progress. If a plugin is missing on startup, a TraySlider message will be shown.\nPlugin/API\nAdded another overload for UncachedFileSave(). TraySliders will try to disable/dismiss immediately instead of only when all event handlers have returned. Download requests will be internally threaded regardless of how the method is called but will otherwise act the same.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.8.4.287","version":0,"site":"https://advancedcombattracker.com/","source":"EQAditu","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
