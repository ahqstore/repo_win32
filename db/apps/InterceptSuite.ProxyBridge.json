It redirects TCP and UDP traffic from specific processes through SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies, with the ability to route, block, or allow traffic on a per-application basis. ProxyBridge fully supports both TCP and UDP proxy routing and works at the system level, making it compatible with proxy-unaware applications without requiring any configuration changes.\n🔒 Security Fixes\n- CVE-2026-24402 - Fixed Critical Remote Code Execution and Privilege Escalation via buffer overflow and race condition in Windows application\n🐛 Bug Fixes\nWindows\n- Fixed process name with full path rejecting ( and ) characters (#32)\n- Fixed application slowing down internet speed by 70-80% (#41)\n- Fixed kernel driver not unloading on app crash or force close (#42)\n- Fixed race condition in data writer causing invalid local config file (#57)\n- Fixed high memory and CPU usage (#55)\nmacOS\n- Fixed signing issues (#29)\n- Fixed extension memory not being released on app close, causing unwanted resource usage and duplicate proxy rules on load (#51)\n- Fixed proxy rule window size issue (#52)\n- Fixed high CPU usage on traffic spikes (#49)\n⚡ Performance Improvements\nWindows\n- Connection and Activity log searching now uses memory more efficiently with better performance on large logs\n- C core now uses O(1) algorithm with more effective connection tracking\n- Improved C memory management:\n  - Added garbage collection\n  - More efficient memory allocation\n  - Improved sorting algorithms in both C and C#\n  - Fixed memory leaks\n- GUI improvements:\n  - More efficient garbage collection\n  - Reduced log retention to last 100 connections\n  - Optimized memory usage across GUI, CLI, and C core\n- Reduced installer size\n- Improved C compiler optimizations\nmacOS\n- IPC now uses less memory\n- Optimized CPU usage during traffic spikes\nGeneral\n- Relay server can now handle large connections with improved memory efficiency\n- Fixed bottleneck between kernel-level connections and relay\n- ProxyBridge can now handle thousands of connections per second with efficient memory and CPU usage\n- ProxyBridge can now handle 1gbps to 2.5gbps network speed\n✨ New Features\n- Traffic Logging Toggle: Windows and macOS apps now support disabling traffic logging\n- Windows Startup: Windows app now supports launching on Windows startup (#47)\n📦 Updates\n- Runtime: Upgraded from .NET 9 to .NET 10\n- UI Framework: Upgraded Avalonia from 11.2.0 to 11.3.11\nℹ️ Platform Updates\nLinux support postponed. Linux support was initially planned for this release but has been postponed due to significant development challenges. Implementing feature parity with Windows and macOS requires substantial architectural work and effort. After initial development attempts encountered multiple technical issues, we decided to focus on stabilizing the Windows and macOS versions first. Linux support remains in our roadmap, but no release timeline has been finalized. See commit 6dfed95 for details.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1.0","version":0,"site":"https://interceptsuite.com/","source":"InterceptSuite","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
