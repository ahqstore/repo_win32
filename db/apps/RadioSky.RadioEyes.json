Radio Eyes is not just a typical sky viewer that has mappings for radio objects. It is a tool to help you plan and execute your radio observations. Some of the features include:\n- RADEC and Dome type sky views.\n- Customizable catalogues of radio objects.\n- Separate pulsar catalog.\n- Load background maps for various frequencies.\n- Customize labels for presentation graphics.\n- Antenna beam object.\n- Develop drift scan tables.\n- Track objects.\n- Create active content from internet sources.\n- Switch to the views from other observatories.\n- Plot JPL Ephemeris data.\n- Show planets, stars, constellations.\n- Antenna positioning support.\n- Control your radiotelescope remotely.\nATNF pulsar files are automatically updated when you restart\nRE. The current version can be seen shown by selecting\nView / Pulsars.\n\nThe JPL Ephemeris tool now converts the file to Windows text.\nThe JPL downloads have changed to Unix text format.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.5.7","version":0,"site":"https://radiosky.com/","source":"Radio-Sky Publishing","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
