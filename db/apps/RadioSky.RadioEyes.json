Radio Eyes is not just a typical sky viewer that has mappings for radio objects. It is a tool to help you plan and execute your radio observations. Some of the features include:\n- RADEC and Dome type sky views.\n- Customizable catalogues of radio objects.\n- Separate pulsar catalog.\n- Load background maps for various frequencies.\n- Customize labels for presentation graphics.\n- Antenna beam object.\n- Develop drift scan tables.\n- Track objects.\n- Create active content from internet sources.\n- Switch to the views from other observatories.\n- Plot JPL Ephemeris data.\n- Show planets, stars, constellations.\n- Antenna positioning support.\n- Control your radiotelescope remotely.\nIn addition to a number of bug fixes, this update has two\nnew/improved tools under the Tools menu.\n\nThe Fringe Calculator has significant updates.  It now works for\ncalculating either object declination or fringe period. Two new\nplots are available.  Plot Fringe vs Declination gives you a\nlook at how these parameters relate. Plot Fringe Pattern\nproduces a graph of how the relative intensity of a signal\nchanges during meridian transit. Plots are available for\nPhase Switched or Adding type instruments.\n\nA Dispersion Measure (DM) calculator has been added.  Given\nupper and lower frequencies and the time delay of signal\nappearance between them, DM is calculated. Also the\nexpected delay for a given DM may be computed.\n\nA catalog of FRBs (fast radio bursta) from the CHIME group\nis now included.\n\nI am aware that some of the included Active Label files\n(.rls), no longer function due to website changes on\ntheir target URLs.  I am working on this.\n\nOn Line Help has a new look.  Clear your old pages when\nusing it.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.5.9","version":0,"site":"https://radiosky.com/","source":"Radio-Sky Publishing","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
