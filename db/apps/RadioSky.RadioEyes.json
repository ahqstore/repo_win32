Some of the features include:\n- RADEC and Dome type sky views.\n- Customizable catalogues of radio objects.\n- Separate pulsar catalog.\n- Load background maps for various frequencies.\n- Customize labels for presentation graphics.\n- Antenna beam object.\n- Develop drift scan tables.\n- Track objects.\n- Create active content from internet sources.\n- Switch to the views from other observatories.\n- Plot JPL Ephemeris data.\n- Show planets, stars, constellations.\n- Antenna positioning support.\n- Control your radiotelescope remotely.\nFixes a bug in the new Fringe Calculator that prevented the\nplot of fringe period vs declination.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.5.10","version":0,"site":"https://radiosky.com/","source":"Radio-Sky Publishing","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
