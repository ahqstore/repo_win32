If a folder existed previously in that path we couldn't create it again.\n✅ Add a retry wrapper to all requests. Now, if a request has a network error or a 429 error retry until the request can be made or if it has a server error 5XX, retry 3 times. The delay between requests is multiplied by 2. First, 5s, then 10s, and so.\n✅ Remove duplication of requests. When the same request is made multiple times reuse the same request to make the application more performant and reduce the server workload.\n✅ Add abort to requests and handle successfully the response.\n✅ Improve and simplify the way we upload moved files.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.5.5","version":0,"site":"https://internxt.com/","source":"Internxt","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
