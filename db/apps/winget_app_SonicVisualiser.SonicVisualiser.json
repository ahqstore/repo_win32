With interpolation switched off,\n  the individual samples are shown as unconnected points instead\n\n• Make it possible to toggle segment colouring in the segmentation\n  view of the time value layer, as well as toggling segment division\n  lines\n\n• When importing CSV files, if a column heading indicates a likely\n  unit for the column, use it by default; also remember last user\n  settings for the import dialog\n\n• Ensure the Choose Default Template option on the templates menu can\n  be reached even when no file is loaded\n\n• Give the spectrum layer the same effective scale range as it had\n  before the dB scale fix in v4.4, fixing the accidental halving of\n  the visible range for that layer in v4.4\n\n• Fix hang when opening two plugin parameter dialogs at once\n\n• Fix crash when rendering slice or spectrum layers scrolled to\n  earlier than the start of the audio or later than the end\n\n• Fix crash when more than one audio file is supplied at the command\n  line with a default session template that requires regenerating one\n  or more feature extraction layers and layer generation produces an\n  error or warning\n\n• Fix failure to exit fully if the window is closed before plugin\n  scan is complete at startup","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.5","site":"https://sonicvisualiser.org/","source":"sonicvisualiser.org","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public License, Version 2 or later","resources":null,"verified":false}
