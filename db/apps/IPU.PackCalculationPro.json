We select well-proven default values for most coefficients and parameters, while allowing you to customize these defaults, import your own cooling/heating load profile data, to meet your specific needs.\nOur comprehensive database of commercially available compressors, maintained in cooperation with OEMs, makes it possible to compare performance of different products using a single definition for the operating conditions.\n- Ejector cycles:\n  - Dimensioning of vapour ejectors, low-pressure-lift and high-pressure-lift.\n  - Major improvements to all ejector cycle calculations.\n- Rating points UI:\n  - State point diagrams, table and log(p)-h diagrams fully implemented for most cycles. Supporting flooded evaporators.\n  - Log(p)-h diagram shows all available properties at mouse cursor position.\n- Refrigerant data:\n  - R290 (propane) data updated, to allow operating at high condensing temperatures in heat pumps.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.6.5.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.ipu.dk/","source":"IPU","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
