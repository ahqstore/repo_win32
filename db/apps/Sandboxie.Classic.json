This fix restores proper functionality for Firefox users, resolving a major disruption introduced in the previous version.\nIn addition to the Firefox fix, this update introduces a new configuration option, BindAdapterIP, which allows users to bind sandboxed applications to a specific host IP address. This can be defined globally or per process via the INI file, offering greater control over network behavior within the sandbox. Itâ€™s important to note that the specified IP must be bound to a local network interface, or connections will fail.\nSeveral additional issues have been resolved, including problems affecting Thunderbird. Memory leaks related to process command line retrieval have been addressed, and missing components like SbieShellExt.dll have been restored.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nKnown Issue\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.70.10","site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"sandboxie-plus.com","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
