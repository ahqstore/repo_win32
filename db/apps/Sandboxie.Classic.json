Firefox now runs smoothly within sandboxed environments once again.\nSecurity enhancements are another major focus. This release addresses a potential IP leakage vulnerability affecting dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 setups when only one proxy type was configured. Connections now fail gracefully if no proxy is set for the relevant IP type, effectively preventing unintentional bypasses and preserving user anonymity—a critical improvement for users relying on VPNs or proxies.\nAdditionally, a serious local privilege escalation vulnerability tied to the HostInjectDll mechanism has been patched, thanks to responsible disclosure. This fix strengthens Sandboxie's role as a secure execution layer.\nFor advanced users, a new debug option OpenAllSysCalls=y has been added, allowing unrestricted system call access for testing purposes. However, due to its permissive nature, it should be used with caution.\nAmong the usability improvements, users can now duplicate sandboxes and their contents directly from the UI, streamlining environment management. The update also introduces a new developer certificate type that disables user-mode component verification for advanced use cases. This node-locked certificate is available at no additional cost to existing Contributor or Eternal/Huge certificate holders upon request.\nOverall, version 1.15.9 brings a thoughtful balance of new features, critical fixes, and user-focused enhancements, reinforcing Sandboxie Plus as a powerful tool for secure application isolation.\nFor a full list of changes please review the change log.\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.70.9","site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"sandboxie-plus.com","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
