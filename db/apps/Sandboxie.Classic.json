The sandbox deletion confirmation prompt has been refined for better clarity. The online updater has been updated to ensure smoother updates, and the Plus installer now includes the ImDisk 3.0 driver for 64-bit systems, expanding its functionality.\nThis release also addresses key issues reported by users. A problem where the \"WriteFilePath\" setting was not functioning correctly has been resolved, ensuring expected behavior when writing files. Additionally, an issue with Box Notes that caused matching lines to be deleted upon saving has been fixed, restoring proper note-taking functionality.\nYou can support the project through donations, any help will be greatly appreciated.\nIf you have issues with an update installation, just uninstall the previous version keeping the sandboxie.ini and reinstall the new build.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.70.8","site":"https://xanasoft.com/","source":"sandboxie-plus.com","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
