Closes #1492.\n  A manual reboot will still be required to complete the EDMarketConnector upgrade process and we make no guarantees about the stability of the application until this is done.\n- The new EDDN fsssignaldiscovered/1 schema has been implemented.\n- EDSM trace level logging will no longer log API credentials unless explicitly asked to, separately from other EDSM API trace logging.\nBug Fixes\n- EDDN: Ensure we always remove all _Localised suffix keys in data. This was missed in some recent new schemas and turned out to be an issue for at least approachsettlement/1.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.4.1.0","site":"https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector","source":"EDCD","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
