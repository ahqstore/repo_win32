Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\nBug Fixes\n- Forwarding Rules Failing - Fixed critical bug where email forwarding rules were completely broken due to TaskCanceledException. Fixes #331 (Thanks, wcwhitehead!)\n- SSL/TLS Connection Mode - Fixed SSL/TLS connection mode to use SslOnConnect for port 465 and Auto for STARTTLS\n- SMTP Timeout - Set proper SMTP timeout of 30 seconds for forwarding rules\n- Backend Service Status - Fixed initial status detection for backend service\nContributors\nSpecial thanks to wcwhitehead for reporting the critical forwarding rules bug!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.5.1","version":0,"site":"https://changemakerstudios.us/","source":"PapercutSMTP","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
