Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\nImprovements\n- Modernized versioning system to use Directory.Build.props instead of GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs\n- Added Windows ARM64 support (#283)\n- Improved port configuration for SMTP and HTTP services (#285, #286, #293)\n- Enhanced Docker support with non-privileged ports (SMTP: 2525, HTTP: 8080)\n- Consolidated documentation and improved Docker build process\nBug Fixes\n- Fixed Windows Service installation and auto-start issues (#294)\n- Fixed Linux path separator handling (#292)\n- Fixed SMTP server options configuration\nBuild System\n- Refactored build.cake to reduce code duplication\n- GitVersion now populates version properties via MSBuild\n- Removed deprecated assembly patching approach","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"7.0.2","version":0,"site":"https://changemakerstudios.us/","source":"PapercutSMTP","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
