However, as the project evolved, this launcher is now a game client for all currently released miHoYo Games.\n\n\n> We've recently released a new launcher status tracker! Head on over to https://status.collapselauncher.com to see it!\nHi, CryoTechnic here o/\nIt's been a bit since the last preview update. While we've been hard at work with Plugins and other cool things, we've had to release this update. This isn't something we wanted to do, but to preserve the safety of our users, it's what has to be done.\nDue to a reported recent ban for using the Mobile Layout feature, we are disabling it for now by force. While the ban seems to be only applicable for co-op play and is currently limited to Genshin Impact, we're not taking a risk with it and are choosing to disable this feature until we are sure that it is safe to use for our users.\nIf you have similar issues with this feature and/or other features that are known to cause issues with account standing (whether it be a suspension or a ban), please contact us immediately.\nIf you are from HoYo, thank you, for doing this to your players, I'm sure that the cloud subscription you guys are offering (among other things but we won't be opening that can of worms today) is worth it!\nAsset Availability post-delete Feature Status\nCurrently, only Zenless Zone Zero and Honkai: Impact 3rd support ignoring assets for past mission resources. Support for other titles is pending and will be released in the next version.\nServicing/Maintenance Mode Phase\nVersion 1.82.17 onwards will mark the \"Servicing/Maintenance Mode\" part of our development cycle, meaning that 1.82.xx releases will no longer get any improvements or new features, unless any urgent changes or bug fixes need to be pushed or backported from our Preview branch.\nOther new features, improvements and changes will be pushed in preview release, 1.83.xx [Codename: Luna].\nHit us on our Official Discord or Create an Issue if you have ideas what features or changes you want to have in later 1.83.xxx or future release.\nMore information regarding the changes can also be found in the changelog belowðŸ‘‡\nWhat's Changed?\n- [Imp] Update Discord RPC submodule, by @bagusnl\n- [New] Update backend install and repair systems for Honkai: Impact 3rd Sophon changes:\n  - Add fetcher for Block files.
