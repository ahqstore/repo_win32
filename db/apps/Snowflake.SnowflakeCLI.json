It is a flexible and extensible tool that can accommodate modern development practices and technologies.\nWith Snowflake CLI, developers can create, manage, update, and view apps running on Snowflake across workloads such as Streamlit in Snowflake, the Snowflake Native App Framework, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowpark. It supports a range of Snowflake features, including user-defined functions, stored procedures, Streamlit in Snowflake, and SQL execution.\nNew features and updates\n- Updated the snow streamlit deploy command to use the updated CREATE STREAMLIT syntax (FROM source_location) instead of the deprecated syntax (ROOT_LOCATION = ‘<stage_path_and_root_directory>’).\n  Note\n  The deprecated syntax is still supported, but Snowflake recommends using the new syntax for better clarity and consistency. You can use the snow streamlit deploy --legacy option to continue using the deprecated syntax.\nBug fixes\n- None.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.14.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.snowflake.com/","source":"Snowflake, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
