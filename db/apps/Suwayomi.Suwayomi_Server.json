Checkout the CHANGELOG.md for the full list of changes.\nGraphQL API\nWe have redone our whole API in GraphQL. We are excited to get this out there so more Suwayomi clients like JUI and Sorayomi can use it! GraphQL is a great technology and provides much more flexibility then our previous REST API.\nRename to Suwayomi\nWe've had the rename in the works for a while, we wanted to have a better branding. Tachidesk doesn't actually make sense, its a mix of 2 languages, and Tachi means standing. We ended up deciding on Suwayomi, which is a shorthand for Suwariyomi(sitting reading).\nNew Launcher for Suwayomi\nWe needed a better experience when launching the application, a launcher was a great idea. We've got all the settings available in the launcher so you can configure everything you need before launching!\nMore Changes!\n- Automatic WebUI Updates\n- Preserve download queue through server restarts\n- Improve compatability with Android extensions\n- Add support for ComicInfo creation and reading\n- Support changing settings with WebUI and other clients\n- Support more SOCKS proxy settings\n- Fix support for Oracle JRE\n- Performance improvements\n- Partial Tracking support\n- Support Custom Repos\n- FlareSolverr(Cloudflare Bypass) support\n- And many more fixes and features, this was a big release\n- WebUI changes: https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-WebUI/releases/tag/v1.0.0\nContributors:\n@Syer10, @AriaMoradi, @schroda, @chancez, @Mercenar, @Robonau, @tachimanga, @brianmakesthings, @alexandrejournet, @aless2003, @vuhe, @MangaCrushTeam, @martinek, @akabhirav, @DattatreyaReddy","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Suwayomi","source":"Suwayomi","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
