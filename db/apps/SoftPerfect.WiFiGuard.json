It is a specialised monitoring application that runs through your network at set intervals and reports immediately if it has found any unrecognised connected devices that could possibly belong to an intruder.\nKey features\n- Pings computers and other network devices and displays those online.\n- Detects firewalled computers that do not respond to ping.\n- Scans your network at a specified interval.\n- Immediately alerts you if an unknown device is found.\n- Added: Activity heat map showing device activity at a glance.\n- Added: Configurable discovery attempts parameter in settings.\n- Added: Usage statistics in the About dialog.\n- Added: Device icon display in Device Catalog.\n- Fixed: Devices occasionally appearing as duplicates.\n- Fixed: Custom device comments being overwritten by automatic comments.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"25.12","version":0,"site":"https://www.softperfect.com/","source":"SoftPerfect Pty Ltd","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
