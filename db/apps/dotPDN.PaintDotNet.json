It features an intuitive and innovative user interface with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of useful and powerful tools. An active and growing online community provides friendly help, tutorials, and plugins.\nThis update is mostly a hotfix that fixes installation on Windows Server systems.\n- Fixed: Installation on Windows Server will no longer fail with an error about a missing srclient DLL.\n- Improved: When saving an image fails due to Windows Defender's \"Controlled Folder Access\" setting, the error message will mention that instead of being a generic \"I/O failure\" message.\n- New: GIF Comment metadata is now preserved. It maps to EXIF Photo.UserComment tags.\n- Improved: Consolidated the number of threads used for Async Present from 3 per image (canvas, left ruler, top ruler) to 3 total.\n- Improved: ColorManagementEffect now supports DxgiColorSpace color contexts (for plugin developers).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.1.4","site":"https://dotpdn.com/","source":"dotPDN LLC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
