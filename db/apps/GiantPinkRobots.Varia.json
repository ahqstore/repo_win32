It uses the amazing aria2 to handle the downloads.\nIt supports basic functionality like continuing incomplete downloads from the previous session upon startup, pausing/cancelling all downloads at once, setting a speed limit, authentication with a username/password, setting the simultaneous download amount and setting the download directory.\n- Windows only: Varia now uses native window decorations for better integration and stability.\n- New safeguards against having the aria2c process keep running in the case of a crash.\n- Slight UI tweaks. The header bar also now shows the amount of downloads, and how many are completed.\n- Updates to translations.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2025.4.22","site":"https://github.com/giantpinkrobots","source":"Giant Pink Robots!","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
