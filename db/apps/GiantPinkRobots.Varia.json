It uses the amazing aria2 to handle the downloads.\nIt supports basic functionality like continuing incomplete downloads from the previous session upon startup, pausing/cancelling all downloads at once, setting a speed limit, authentication with a username/password, setting the simultaneous download amount and setting the download directory.\nThis release only involves the Windows (Installer) version as it fixes an issue that stops the \"Update available\" banner from appearing. Windows (Portable) and Linux versions aren't affected.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2025.7.19-1","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/giantpinkrobots","source":"Giant Pink Robots!","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
