LockHunter is useful for fighting against malware, and other programs that are blocking files without a reason. Unlike other similar tools it deletes files into the recycle bin so you may restore them if deleted by mistake.\nKey Features\n- Shows processes locking a file or folder\n- Gives you detailed information on the process\n- Allows to unlock, delete, copy or rename a locked file\n- Can delete a file at next OS restart\n- Allows to kill locking process\n- Allows to remove locking processes from hard drive\n- Can unload DLLs from processes\n- Integrates in to Explorer menu\n- It deletes files into the recycle bin, so you may restore them if deleted by mistake\n- Supports both 32 and 64 bit Windows\nNew version of LockHunter is available! We have added support of high DPI displays, the portable version and fixed some bugs.\n\nSupport of high DPI\nThe previous version of the program displayed blurry dialogs when you work on a monitor with high DPI.\nThe newer version supports non standard DPI and the UI should look crisp.\n\nPortable version\nPer many user requests we have added a portable edition of LockHunter. It’s also supplied in the form of installer but it allows to install the program to an external drive (or even to a cloud drive) and then use it on any computer. The portable version stores its settings in a configuration file (rather than the registry) and save log file to the folder of its executable. It doesn’t have an integration to Windows Explorer and as installable version requires administrative permissions. It will run on both Windows 64 bit and 32 bit (though, there are less than 5% of our users are still on it).\nThis our first experience with portable software so your suggestions or notes on how can we improve it are very welcome.\n\nBugs fixed\n- An error displayed when the program was maximized on the previous start\n\nUpdate from Oct 27th, 2021\n- Bug fixed: Winget couldn’t read the program version, therefore it always displayed LockHunter requires upgrade\n\nHow to update from the previous version?\nJust download and install the required installer over the previous version. You do not need to uninstall the previous version.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.4.3.146","version":0,"site":"https://crystalrich.com/","source":"Crystal Rich Ltd","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
