simulation software\n\nOpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying them.\nNew Features:\n- 3D Printing Support: Export any component or combination to OBJ file (fixes #604)\n- RASAero compatibility: Import/Export CDX1 files (fixes #875 and #1147)\n- Dark mode (normal and high-contrast) and custom UI font size support (fixes #1089)\n- Export sim table to CSV (fixes #2077)\nBug Fixes:\n- Fix Tube fin drag (fixes #2065)\n- Fix Base drag when using Cd override (fixes base drag hack sim error, fixes #2118)\n- Fix Atmospheric pressure when using ISA conditions (fixes #2103)\n- Properly sanitize XML in ORK file (eliminates corrupt ORK files, fixes #2051)\nOther New Features\n- Bumped app to Java 17\n- Export and import preferences to XML file\n- Display secondary stability unit.\n  This means you can display stability in both calibers and percentage of length (fixes #2079)\n- Added \"cases\" and \"manufacturers\" substitution in motor config names (fixes #2055 and #2204)\n- Selection of \"common name\" or \"manufacturer's designation\" in motor selection table is now reflected everywhere else in the program (fixes #2072)\n- Added \"plugged\" option in charge delay combobox (fixes #2090)\n- Added motor type to \"show details\" in motor selection (fixes #2069)\n- Added instances settings in launch lug config (fixes #2035)\n- Account for fin cant in fin root points, and support canted fins in fin marking guide (fixes #2231 and #2242)\n- Set cluster tube separation in absolute or relative units (fixes #1970)\n- Support transparent rendering and export of Photo Studio images (fixes #2076)\n- Added \"Select -> Components of same color\" and \"Select -> None\" options (fixes #2129)\n- Remember column width, order and visibility in component preset table (fixes #2357)\nBug Fixes\n- Fixed mass issues with fin sets (fixes #2217)\n- Fixed CG issues for launch lugs and rail buttons (fixes #2040)\n- Improved rail button drag calculations\n- Added parts detail for pods and boosters (fixes #2084)\n- Fixed parachute position when using auto radius (fixes #2036)\n- Fixed pod set and booster marker position under certain circumstances (fixes #2047)\n- Fix CG marker location in top view (fixes #2050)\n- Handle zero-area fins (warn and don't crash with NaN error) (fixes #2032)\n- Don't dispose config dialog when no components are selected in 3D view (fixes #2108)\n- Display ISA values in temp and pressure fields (fixes #2104)\n- Improved simulation of fins on transitions and nose cones (fixes #2113)\n- Cleaned up multi-sim editing (fixes #2138 and #1826)\n- Update ruler units immediately when preferences are changed (fixes #2151)\n- Compute CG and CP based on currently active stages (fixes #2171)\n- Improved mass/CG calculations for fillets (fixes 2209)\n- Set auto radius correctly for mass objects (fixes #2267)\n- Apply radial positioning to multi-engine clusters (fixes #2283)\n- Fixed 3D rendering of fin tabs (fixes #2286)\n- Update recent file list when opening via file association (fixes #2222)\n- Corrected the columns displayed in the component preset table's popup menu, ensuring only relevant columns appear\n- Ensured optimum delay is saved in flight summary and .ork files (fixes #2353)\n- Corrected longitudinal moment of inertia calculations by excluding shoulders (fixes #2278)\n- Fixed exception when setting wind speed to zero (fixes #2386)\n- Fixed unexpected mass and CG override interaction (fixes #2394)\nMiscellaneous\n- Updated example rockets (including brand-new two stage example)\n- Show calculated values in override tab (fixes #1629)\n- Decrease minimum FoV to 10 degrees in Photo Studio\n- Increase resolution of launch temperature and pressure to 2 decimal places (fixes #2003)\n- Display Cd override with 3 decimal places\n- Added wiki button to help menu (fixes #2046)\n- Eliminate option to save \"some\" sim data (fixes #2024)\n- Added OK/Cancel buttons when editing simulations (fixes #2158)\n- Added OK/Cancel buttons when editing preferences (fixes #2266)\n- Added multi-sim edit indicators (fixes #2159)\n- Show warning when motor file has illegal format (fixes #2150)\n- Reset window position if off-screen (fixes #2141)\n- Keep current field value when \"auto\" option is unchecked (fixes #2096)\n- Open dialog to save design info when first saving file\n- Added '3D Printable Nose Cone and Fins' to example rockets\n- Use more sensible colors for thrust curve selection in motor selection dialog (fixes #2385)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"23.09","site":"https://github.com/openrocket","source":"OpenRocket","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
