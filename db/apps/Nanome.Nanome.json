With Nanome, top R&D labs conduct cutting-edge research but, Nanome isn’t just for experts, it’s also used by students and amateur scientists studying chemistry and biology. Anyone can build 3D molecules or simulate an entire protein made of hundreds of atoms, all in one collaborative environment. Transform the way you learn and design molecular structures with Nanome.\nNew Features and Improvements\n- Added Passthrough Mixed Reality support for the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro devices via the wrist menu\n- Added support for Meta Avatars which enable avatar customization on Meta devices and presets for Non-meta devices enhancing social presence\n- Added support for the Meta Quest Pro Device\n- Changed the Locomotion mechanism to a discrete state now activated through the “Edit Position” button on the wrist menu\n- Added a Content Discovery Menu to replace Advanced Tutorials\n- Added the time to the wrist menu and removed the wrist watch\n- Added the X button to be a hotkey for mute/unmute the microphone\n- Added transition states (fade to black) during loading states for a smoother user experience\n- License locked Atom Labels\n- License locked Surfaces\n- License Locked Spatial Playback functionality (Rewind, Fast-forward, and interact)\n- License locked the Duplicate Molecule feature\n- Removed the “Open All” button from the wrist menu\n- Adjusted all menus sizes to be smaller for Mixed Reality\n- Added ability to have guests steal presenter by grabbing an unlocked molecule\n- Added a “Internet Connection is lost” prompt in the lobby when disconnected from internet\n- Hide avatars for when a user is too close to another user\n- Changed notifications prompt to spawn in front of the user\n- Added a prompt for adding Microphone Permissions to the Nanome App when first launching\n- Removed “Teleport Out” from the Action menu\n- Changed the Wrist Menu design\n- Moved the Spatial Recording button in the wrist menu into the Room button on the Wrist menu\n- Combined the View Presenter Requests and Request Presenter Button in the wrist menu\n- Added Parental Control lock for the web browser accessible via https://home.nanome.ai\n- Removed automatic user teleportation from the Spatial Recordings\n- Removed automatic face-center of room when teleporting tiles via locomotion\n- Added a specific Alphafold Coloring Schema\n- Added a toggle between desktop and mobile view for the in-VR Web Browser\n- Added a quick-save button on the wrist menu\n- Added ability to anchor a workspace to a physical room via Spatial Anchors\n- Added the ability to bring your desk into XR and snap the whiteboard to it\n- Changing the Complex name now emits a complexUpdate event to the Plugin System\n- Disabled Merging two proteins\n- Increased the accuracy of the Device Limiter\n- Adjusted Wrist menu location due to new avatars\n- Updated Quick tool switch interaction to ignore trigger action\n- Added a notification if a user tries to search from the load menu without any text\n- Inverted the Fo-Fc Colors for Electron Density Maps to be more scientifically accurate\n- Added new substructure ID Filters\n- Added a voice indicator and mute button  to the Lobby’s avatar preview mirror\n- Added a cancel button to the Load Menu\n- Added the option to Combine molecules with and without chain renaming\n- Enabled rendering backsidee of surfaces for PCVR\n- SDF v2000 parsing captures formal charges\n- Hydrogens computation now stores formal charges on all involved atoms\n- Removed disabled Change Avatar button from Avatar Menu when inside a room\n- Default disabled automatic height adjustment for users in Mixed Reality\n- Added Auto-join and Auto Idle Rejoin\n- Supporting Self-hosted Quickdrop for Enterprise\n- Added Presentation Setup Options to config and Action Menu.
