A screenshot of those lines will be put on the clipboard. The lines must all be visible on screen.\n- In the Java editor, middle-click the name of any other class to go to its definition/documentation. (Also available on right-click menu.)\n- When you inspect a String object, new pane for string content and new \"Copy to clipboard\" button.\n- New \"Re-run\" button on left side of main window, re-runs last constructor or static method (or JavaFX app) with same parameters. (Compiles first, if needed.)\n- The New Class dialog now has a new dropdown: Template or Minimal; the latter lets you create a class/interface/enum/record/etc without anything in the body.\n- New checkbox in Preferences, in Interface -> General that lets you turn off re-opening last open projects.\n- Slightly increased the space for line numbers to help with four-digit line numbers.\n- Terminal window has new \"Always on top\" menu option.\n- Made Cmd-comma open preferences on macOS.\n- Ctrl-+ should increase font size on non-QWERTY keyboards.\n- Increased default font size to 12 in new installations.\n- Line numbers on by default in new installations.\n- Editor tabs can be dragged to reorder them in the editor windows.\n- Ctrl-scrollwheel on Windows and Linux, and two finger pinch-zoom gesture on all OSes changes the editor font size.\n- Changed the default Java editor and terminal font to \"Source Code Pro\", which supports box-drawing characters.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.5.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.bluej.org/","source":"BlueJ Team","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public License version 2","resources":null,"verified":false}
