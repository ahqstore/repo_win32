This means that:\n  - Translations appear much faster, and with higher quality.\n  - The translation process now happens locally on your computer, so the contents of the page you're translating stay private.\n- Changed: pressing cmd/ctrl followed by a number n now moves to the nth tab, rather than moving n tabs left/right.\n- Fixed: pages might be sized incorrectly in some situations.\n- Fixed: parts of the UI might display in light mode even when dark mode is enabled.\n- Updated Dutch translations (@NaudtsRuben)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.35.0","site":"https://minbrowser.org/","source":"PalmerAL","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
