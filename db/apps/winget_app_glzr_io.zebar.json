These requests will now be cached so that they don't have to be re-fetched on the next launch (also improving performance!). The default caching duration is 1 week and can be configured in the widget's settings.Since some requests should not be cached, there's also a way to add rules for URL's that match a given regex. For example, if you make a fetch for stock market data or social feeds, you'd likely want to cache it for less time than something like a font file.cachingRunning shell commands (#160)\nIt’s now possible to run shell commands! This means you can now launch programs and scripts programmatically. There’s 2 new API’s:\n- shellExec - Executes a program and waits till exit. Returns its stdout, stderr, and exit status.\n- shellSpawn - Executes a program without waiting for exit. Allows for interaction with the spawned process (e.g. listening to stdout/stderr, writing to stdin, and killing the process).\nimport * as zebar from 'zebar';\n\nconst curl = await zebar.shellExec('curl', 'https://www.google.com');\nconsole.log(curl.stdout);\n\nconst ping = await zebar.shellSpawn('ping', '127.0.0.1 -n 10 -w 3000');\nping.onStdout(output => console.log('stdout', output));\nping.onStderr(output => console.log('stderr', output));\nping.onExit(output => console.log('exit', output));\n\n// Interacting with the spawned process:\nping.write('hello world!');\nping.kill();\n\nSince shell commands can run destructive actions, there’s a UI to configure which commands a widget is allowed to run. This is mainly for the sake of an upcoming feature (see below!), so that if a widget is shared with others, they can check what shell privileges it uses.shellOther features\n- Add pause button to with-glazewm starter config (#180).\n- Make the text in the starter examples non-selectable (#176).\n🐛 Bug fixes\n- Export audio provider TypeScript types.\n📘 Docs improvements\n- Add docs for media provider functions.\n- Add docs for isPaused to glazewm provider (#182).\nUpcoming feature: community/marketplace 🚀\nCurrently in development is a new community/marketplace feature where you can download and run widgets that other people submit. Widgets would be uploadable through a community GitHub repo. And then through the settings UI, there will be a tab where all widgets are listed and instantly downloadable.If you have ideas/feedback on the feature, drop a message in the #zebar-chat channel on Discord!\nBig thanks to @HolbyFPV, @michidk, and @veryard for contributing to this release 💛/ @lars-berger","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.7.0","site":"https://github.com/glzr-io","source":"Glzr Software Pte.
