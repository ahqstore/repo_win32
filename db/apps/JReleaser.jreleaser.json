Its goal is to simplify creating releases and\npublishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.\n\nJReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files,\nbinary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that you‚Äôd like to\npublish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.\nDistribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers\nsuch as Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via JBang.
