Its goal is to simplify creating releases and\npublishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.\n\nJReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files,\nbinary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that you’d like to\npublish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.\nDistribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers\nsuch as Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases\nmay be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, SDKMAN!, and more.\n\nBinaries\nhttps://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/wiki/Release-v1.22.0\nChangelog\n🚀 Features\nassemble\n- 1b123d3 Evaluate templates in missing properties, closes #2020\ncore\n- 7f7949c Warn when a name template cannot be resolved, closes #1960 #1961\ngradle\n- 363b681 Use Directory as input for stagingRepository(), closes #2032\n- 4510cce Add individual setupJdk tasks per configured JDK\njdks\n- 8e0a752 Allow filtering by platform, closes #2000\njlink\n- 8942a05 Resolve multi-release template in JlinkAssemblerProcessor, closes #2030\nsign\n- a5036e0 Support minisign as signature generator, closes #2023\n🐛 Fixes\ngradle\n- 32b8eba Resolve NPE in GitHubReleaser, closes #2009\njdks\n- 7da3bcd Relax conditions for copying JDKs from cache, closes #1993\nrelease\n- 22a90d2 Only delete remote tags for snapshot releases, closes #2010\nunscoped\n- a44555e use correct method when resolving extra properties\n🔄️ Changes\ncore\n- 4523860 Silence warnings when mainClass/module template is not available, closes #1960\nsigning\n- 0928f99 Check that minisign input files exist, closes #2035\n- ada9775 Allow simultaneous signing tools, closes #2035\n🛠 Build\n- 326dfae Upgrade graal to 25.0.1\n- 731473d Update release configuration\n- 6627fea Delete JDK caches on linux\n- 28f139a Delete JDK caches on linux\n- 6af8f03 Clear JDKs cache before build\n- 1e6bdb7 Update release announcements\n- 321a205 Remove some JDKs before assembling Jlink distributions\n- 7d7bb6c Update GH workflows\n- dfcfb2d Only setup platform matching JDKS in CI (jpackage/native-image)\n- f717d3d Update GH workflows\n- de4b148 Update jdks to Java 25, closes #2001\n- a4d9ca0 Downgrade jdks to Java 17\n- a87092b Update jdks to Java 25\n- 10c2983 Update release announcements\n📝 Documentation\n- eb35387 Add HarshMehta112 as a contributor for code\n- e1b6939 Fix links in readme\n- b763392 public keyserver link from http to https\n⚙️ Dependencies\n- 913b31f Update asm to 9.9.1\n- 7df2d0e Update aws-java-sdk to 2.40.15\n- 4f7902f Update bouncycastle to 1.83\n- f0370a9 Update classmate to 1.7.1\n- cadaecd Update commons-codec to 1.20.0\n- 268c3fa Update commons-io to 2.21.0\n- 659aae8 Update commons-jexl to 3.6.1\n- b03fb6b Update commons-lang3 to 3.20.0\n- 8cd6b86 Update commons-text to 1.15.0\n- 43bb779 Update cyclonedx to 0.29.2\n- 2d7f288 Update jackson to 2.20.1\n- 5a269be Update junit5 to 6.0.1\n- 477cdae Update maven-plugin-annotations to 3.15.2\n- 46b7f69 Update plexus-archiver to 4.10.4\n- c107694 Update syft to 1.39.0\n- b429307 Update xz to 1.11\n- f7c2bcd Update download gradle plugin to 5.6.0\n- d791e01 Releasing version 1.22.0\n- d10dafe deploy: Skip publication checks on MavenCentral, closes #2011\n- 1471abd Bump for next development cycle\nContributors\nWe'd like to thank the following people for their contributions:\n- Andres Almiray (@aalmiray)\n- Harsh Mehta\n- Ixchel Ruiz\n- Nico (@gerardnico)\n- Ruth Cupido\n- Tamari Gogebashvili\n- Usman Shaikh","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.22.0","version":0,"site":"https://jreleaser.org/","source":"JReleaser","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
