Its goal is to simplify creating releases and\npublishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.\n\nJReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files,\nbinary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that you‚Äôd like to\npublish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.\nDistribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers\nsuch as Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snapcraft, or get ready to be launched via JBang. Releases\nmay be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, SDKMAN!, and more.\n\nBinaries\nhttps://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/wiki/Release-v1.17.0\nChangelog\nüöÄ Features\nassemble\n- d9c4b97 Support x86 and arm customizations in native-image assembler, closes #1786\n- e95ac89 Let jlink.targetJdks be parameterizable with a matrix, closes #1783\n- caa59db Let nativeImage.graalJdks be parameterizable with a matrix, closes #1782\ncore\n- e968abd Let distributions be parameterized with matrix, closes #1780\ndeploy\n- dd6055f Allow snapshot publications in mavenCentral deployer, closes #1803\nunscoped\n- a293b94 Add custom Scoop manifest\n- d4eb3c3 Add a setup script\nüêõ Fixes\nassemble\n- 3c79265 Relax validation of project properties during assembly, closes #1788\ngradle\n- bc7d621 Fix annotation for ourputDirectory, closes #1809\n- 9df6483 Change cache instructions for outputDirectory property, closes #1777\nhooks\n- 694b0da Filter hooks by matrix.platform when platform selection is configured, closes #1779\nunscoped\n- 80c35cb Correct JSON syntax in init template\n- 8b16954 Correct parameter name for overwriting init templates\n- d345eaf LinkedIn announcement Message contains distribution payload for PUBLIC MemberNetworkVisibility, closes #1789 #1794\n- 24c04bd RestAPIException does not ignore message body, closes #1795\nüîÑÔ∏è Changes\nannounce\n- 12d003c Deprecate twitter, closes #1791\ndeploy\n- c49bdd5 Add missing parameter to logging message\nüß∞ Tasks\nannounce\n- 13d1001 Annotate deprecated announcers\nbuild\n- ddfb824 Remove Twitter from release configuration, closes #1793\nunscoped\n- 7dae42f Update Scoop templates with suggested formatting\nüõ† Build\n- 68bde7b Update release announcements\n- 58d7724 Add license to generated SBOMs\n- 21a6554 Switch to org.gradlex.maven-plugin-development plugin\n- de6f233 Configure linux-aarch64 binaries, closes #980\n- fcb7a1a Upgrade to Gradle 8.12\n- 60ea2ee Update copyright in license headers\n- b595eb4 Bump for next development cycle\nüìù Documentation\n- 4c5f037 Add algomaster99 as a contributor for code\n- b9c68fb Add morisil as a contributor for code\n‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies\n- c5ef944 Update aws-java-sdk to 2.30.26\n- e443456 Update zstd-jni to 1.5.7-1\n- 29e031d Update syft to 1.20.0\n- d48fd9b Update snakeyaml to 2.4\n- 29e5ee6 Update mockito to 5.15.2\n- dc3bba8 Update junit5 to 5.12.0\n- bfb60f6 Update jsonschema to 4.37.0\n- ed632a2 Update cosign to 2.4.3\n- cf25e1a Update commons-codec to 1.18.0\n- 418a2b0 Update byte-buddy to 1.17.1\n- 5b62cfa Update bouncycastle to 1.80\n- d37dc5f Update awaitility to 4.3.0\n- 0ebf9af Update assertj to 3.27.3\n- 30d1905 Releasing version 1.17.0\nContributors\nWe'd like to thank the following people for their contributions:\n- Aman Sharma\n- Andres Almiray (@aalmiray)\n- Kazik Pogoda (@morisil)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.17.0","site":"https://jreleaser.org/","source":"JReleaser","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
