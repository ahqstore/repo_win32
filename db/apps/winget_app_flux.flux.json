But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.\nf.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.\nIt's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.\nf.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the time. When the sun sets, it makes your computer look like your indoor lights. In the morning, it makes things look like sunlight again.\nTell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.\n- Windows 11 additional monitor fix, which is related to a bug with disabling on multiple monitors (also fixed)\n- Disabled “software mouse” cursor for Windows 11 insider","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.134","site":"https://justgetflux.com/","source":"f.lux Software LLC","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
