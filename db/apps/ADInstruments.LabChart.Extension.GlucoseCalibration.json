Refresh the chart view or reload the document to ensure the data and event markers are drawn correctly.\n- Using a temperature channel with Out Of Range data values may caused unexpected results when used as the temperature compensation source channel for a glucose calibration.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.1400","site":null,"source":"ADInstruments","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
