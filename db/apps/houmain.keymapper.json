Up until 4.9 it was documented to start comments like #. Otherwise all configurations should work like before.\nAdded\n- Allow to separate multiple mappings on one line with ;. This is useful for macros which generate multiple mappings. e.g.:\n  swap = $0 >> $1 ; $1 >> $0\n  swap[Y, Z]\n- Allow to add mappings for inputs which are released. e.g.:\n  # trigger when A is released\n  !A >> B\n  # trigger when B is released while A is held\n  A{!B} >> C\n  # trigger when B is released while A is NOT held\n  !A !B >> C\n- Toggling virtual keys can also have immediate effects. Using them as modifiers is toggling them twice:\n  # toggle Virtual1 before and after pressing B\n  # this effectively maps D to A B C\n  Virtual1 >> A ^ C\n  D >> Virtual1{B}\n  # {} may also be empty. This maps C to A B\n  Virtual2 >> B\n  Virtual1 >> A Virtual2{}\n  C >> Virtual1{}\n- Automatically replace Virtual with an unused virtual key. e.g.:\n  # assign different virtual keys to VimMode and CapsWord\n  VimMode = Virtual\n  CapsWord = Virtual\n- Added keymapperctl operation --notify for showing notifications (#282). e.g.:\n  notify = $(keymapperctl --notify \"$0\")\n  F1 >> notify[\"Test\"]\n- Added toggle-active directive, which allows to set a sequence that de-/activates keymapper (#283). e.g.:\n  @toggle-active ScrollLock\n- Added include-optional directive, which includes a file but does not fail when file does not exist.\nFixed\n- Fixed suppressed modifiers getting reapplied (#291).\n- Fixed loading config from \"%HOME%\\.config\\keymapper\" on Windows (#292).\n- Properly releasing keys when UAC prompt appeared on Windows.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.0.0","site":"https://github.com/houmain","source":"Albert Kalchmair","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
