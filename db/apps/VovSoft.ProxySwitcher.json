Instead of configuring applications to switch proxies manually, you simply connect them to this program, and it handles the rotation for you in the background. This approach makes it easy to distribute requests, avoid rate limits â€” all without constantly reconfiguring your software.\n\nKey Features\n- Acts as a local HTTP/HTTPS proxy server\n- Automatically rotates requests through your proxy list\n- Supports SSL/TLS connections\n- Import, export, and manage proxy lists easily\n- Lightweight and simple to use\n- Ideal for developers, testers, marketers, and researchers who need a self-managed rotating proxy server for automation\n\nThis software does not provide proxy URLs. Users must supply their own proxies and ensure they are legally obtained and used in compliance with all applicable laws.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.0.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
