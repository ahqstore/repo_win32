This means that the sbt will exit with error when launched in a directory without build.sbt or project/, with exceptions of sbt new, sbt --script-version etc.\n\nTo override this behavior temporarily, you can use --allow-empty flag. To permanently opt out of the build directory detection, create $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sbt/sbtopts with --allow-empty in it.\n\ncsrMavenDependencyOverride setting\nsbt 1.10.7 updates Coursier to 2.1.11. sbt 1.10.7 also adds a new setting csrMavenDependencyOverride (default: false), which controls the resolution, which respects Maven dependency override mechanism, also known as bill-of-materials (BOM) POM. Since there is a performance regression in the new resolver, we are setting the default to false.\n\nüêõ bug fixes\n- fix: Add csrMavenDependencyOverride to opt into bill-of-material (BOM) respecting Coursier resolution by @eed3si9n in #7970\n- fix: Update the template resolver to use Giter8 0.17.0, which fixes the SLF4J warning by @eed3si9n in #7947\n- fix: Update JLine 2 fork to 9a88bc4 and Jansi to 2.4.1, which fixes crash on Windows on ARM by @Friendseeker in #7952\nüé¨ behind the scene\n- ci: New Scala CLA URL by @eed3si9n in #7929\n- ci: Use new Scala CLA GitHub Action by @Friendseeker in #7953\n- ci: Prepare for sbt 1.10.7 by @Friendseeker in #7957\n- ci: Restore disabled Multirepo integration test by @Friendseeker in #7962\nFull Changelog: v1.10.6...v1.10.7","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.10.7","site":"https://www.lightbend.com/","source":"Lightbend, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
