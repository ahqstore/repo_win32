Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.\n- Fixed Run on Startup broken. (Thanks, rikrak))\n- Drop service installation mention from README by @Kissaki in https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/pull/278\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/compare/7.0.0...7.0.1","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.0.1","site":"https://changemakerstudios.us/","source":"PapercutSMTP","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
