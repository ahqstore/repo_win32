It can come in handy in a number of scenarios, and it features a minimalistic, user-friendly GUI. This application is well suited for those who need to create a sitemap quickly and easily, as it does not require you to complete any complex configurations before performing a scan.\n\nThe application is capable of ignoring certain extensions that are not important and will just increase the scanning time unnecessarily. Moreover, specific URLs can be disregarded. Once a scan has been completed, the program allows you to export the results to XML, CSV, TXT or HTML files. The XML file can be submitted to major search engines (Google, Bing, Yandex, etc.), while the HTML sitemap can allow website visitors to easily navigate on your site.\n\nWith this XML sitemap generator, you can create sitemaps for Google and other search engines. Submit your XML sitemap to \"Google Search Console\". As a website owner, you should keep your sitemap up to date. Google bots read your sitemap regularly, so be sure to include all the content that you want Google to crawl. Avoid including URLs in your sitemaps that shouldn't appear in search. This can waste your crawl budget on pages that shouldn't be indexed.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.5.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
