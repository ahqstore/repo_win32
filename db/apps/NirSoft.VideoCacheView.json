If the video file is\nstored in your browser's cache, this utility can help you to extract the video\nfile from the cache and save it for watching it in the future. It automatically\nscans the entire cache of Internet Explorer, Mozilla-based Web browsers\n(Including Firefox), Opera, and Chrome, and then finds all video files that are\ncurrently stored in it. It allows you to easily copy the cached video files into\nanother folder for playing/watching them in the future. If you have a movie\nplayer that is configured to play flv files, it also allows you to play the\nvideo directly from your browser's cache.\n\nNotice for users of Internet Explorer 10.0 and 11.0: In order to get videos from\nthese versions of IE, you have to press F6 (Advanced Options) and choose the\n'Internet Explorer 10 Cache' option in the 'Load video files...' section.\n- Version 3.11\n  - Updated to read the modified cache structure in the new versions of Chrome (Version 132).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.11","site":"https://www.nirsoft.net/","source":"NirSoft","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
