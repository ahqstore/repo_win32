You can disable this permanently by navigating to 'Settings > Crowdsourcing'. You can view and inspect all active crowdsourcing experiments here.\n- This application collects crash dumps in case of fatal application crashes and sends them to my sentry.io dashboard (can also be disabled in settings).\nNotes for Linux users\n- x86_64-musl binaries are only compatible with libc-musl based distributions (e.g., Alpine Linux).\n- You need to give the binary execute permissions before launching it: chmod +x GalaxyBudsClient\nHow to fix connection issues on WindowsIf you experience issues while connecting or using the Galaxy Buds with this app, you can do the following:\n1. Unregister your earbuds in the app if not already done, like this: Options > Unregister device\n2. Proceed to the device selection page\n3. Disable the switch with the label 'Use alternative Bluetooth backend' (Windows only)\n4. Select your earbuds from the list and continue\nGet it on Google Play\nThank you for 3800+ stars on GitHub!\nFull Changelog: 5.1.1...5.1.2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.1.2-b39e90","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/timschneeb","source":"timschneeb","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
