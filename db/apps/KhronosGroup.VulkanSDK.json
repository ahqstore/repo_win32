Vulkan provides applications with control over the system execution and the system memory to maximize application efficiency on a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.\nThe Vulkan SDK enables Vulkan developers to develop Vulkan applications. It includes:\n- Vulkan API usage validation thanks to the Khronos Validation layer.\n- Vulkan Layers configuration thanks to Vulkan Configurator.\n- SPIR-V Shader compilation, optimization and validation tools such as slang, DXC, SPIRV Reflect, and SPIRV-cross. See the SPIR-V Toolchain document for a complete list of the tools included.\n- Vulkan API capture and replay for Vulkan debugging thanks to GFXReconstruct.\n- Vulkan Capabilities Viewer. The new and perfered way to identify your devices capabilities, and contribute to an open source database of GPU capabilities.\n- Third-party libraries and tools such as GLM, SDL, Volk, and VMA.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4.321.1","site":"https://www.lunarg.com/","source":"LunarG Inc.","license_or_tos":"MIT or Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
