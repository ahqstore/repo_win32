The 2D barcode on each disclosure order can be scanned using a handheld scanner. An XML file is then filled with this data. The data in the XML file can be supplemented directly on-screen. Several cross-checks ensure that the user input complies with the form requirements.\nSnaptax then generates report form 685 using the validated XML file. The result can be stored either as a “flat” PDF or an editable QDF file by means of the free Snapform Viewer. Alternatively, Snaptax can send the result directly to the printer.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.0.4","site":"https://www.snapform.com/","source":"Ringler Informatik AG","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
