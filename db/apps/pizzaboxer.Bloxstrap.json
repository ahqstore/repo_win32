For some context, Roblox now whitelists what Fast Flags are allowed to be used by players (Devforum announcement). They've also been cracking down on multi-instance launching and now have preventative anti-measures for it.\nAll of Bloxstrap's other features like modding and activity detection will continue to work. We'll also be adding some new presets in the future that Roblox has decided to allow for.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.10.0","version":0,"site":"https://pizzaboxer.xyz/","source":"pizzaboxer","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
