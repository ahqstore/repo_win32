It does this by implementing all the major screen mirroring technologies such as AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast into one screen mirroring receiver. With AirServer enabled on your big screen, users can use their devices such as an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Android, Nexus, Pixel, Chromebook, or a Windows 10 PC to wirelessly mirror their display over to the big screen, instantly turning the room into a collaborative space.\n- Fixed Google Cast.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.7.1","site":"https://www.appdynamic.com/","source":"App Dynamic","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
