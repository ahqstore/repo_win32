Its funny a lot of people consider Tauon a new app but its not really new any more.With this release comes with a small icon refresh and name change. Previously Tauon Music Box, now in most places the app will simply be referred to as Tauon, as demanded by our marketing team. Its what most people refer to it already anyway. For now \"Tauon Music Box\" will still be used in some places such as install paths and in the main website domain.Other Changes:\n- Tauon now uses libgme to enable native support for the following video game music formats:\n    - AY        (ZX Spectrum/Amstrad CPC)\n    - GBS       (Nintendo Game Boy)\n    - GYM       (Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)\n    - HES       (NEC TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine)\n    - KSS       (MSX Home Computer/other Z80 systems)\n    - NSF/NSFE  (Nintendo NES/Famicom)\n    - SAP       (Atari systems using POKEY sound chip)\n    - SPC       (Super Nintendo/Super Famicom)\n    - VGM/VGZ   (Sega Master System/Mark III, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive,BBC Micro)\n- Added a new high contrast dark theme (Thanks @CryHavoc21)\n- Improved cover fetching for Discord reliability (Thanks @G2-Games)\n- Improved encoding detection for CUE sheets (Fixes common Russian language CUE sheets)\n- Tweaked how album in the gallery view art split, with a new added gallery setting \"Merge multi disc albums\". This may need further tweaking.\nIve also added a donate button to the main menu. :wink:","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.8.0","site":"https://github.com/Taiko2k","source":"Taiko2k","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
