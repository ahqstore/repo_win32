The \"S\" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with the GUI based on Qt toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI.\nNew features\n- Added microstrip lines simulation support for Ngspice. Ngspice version >=45 is required. See #1401 #1402\n- Added Jiles-Atherton magnetic core model. The same model is used by MicroCAP simulator. Added a new\n  device group magnetic cores containing two new devices: Winding and Magnetic core #1284\n- Added new Image paiting. This component allows to put a raster image on schematic #1403\n- Added VDMOS device support #1326\n- Massive redesign of schematic rendering engine, enable arbitrary angle wires #1226\n- Hide the component properties incompatible with the selected simulator #974\nGeneral improvements and bugfixes\n- Implemented open recent project #705\n- Fixed symbol editing issues #945\n- Improved S-parameter files viewer #1309\n- Added context menu for document tabs #1362\n- Fixed printing issues #1452\n- Added possibility to plot noise contribution #1439\n- Fixed settings directory for
