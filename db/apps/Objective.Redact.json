Protect yourself and your organisation from accidental disclosure.\n\nIt’s an awful feeling when, after manually redacting a document, you can’t help but wonder if you’ve got every word.

Objective Redact is a powerful, automated redaction software that makes redaction much faster, internal review much simpler, and keeps your most sensitive information safe.\nIdeal for compliance and disclosure processes, Objective Redact quickly and easily redacts information, no matter how large or complex your documents are.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"25.6.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.objective.com/","source":"Objective Corporation Limited","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
