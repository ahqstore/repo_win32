If you are using Clang 19, adding -mllvm -tail-dup-pred-size=100000 should restore the original performance.\n- Fixes building LLDB with ncurses support when terminfo symbols are provided in a separate tinfo library.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"20.1.1","site":"https://llvm.org","source":"LLVM","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0 with LLVM Exceptions","resources":null,"verified":false}
