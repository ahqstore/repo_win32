Developing a device driver that works in kernel mode on windows is extremely technical. By using Dokan, you can create your own file systems very easily without writing device drivers. Dokan is similar to FUSE (Linux file system in user space) but works on Windows. Moreover, dokany includes a FUSE wrapper that helps you to port your FUSE filesystems without changes.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.3.1.1000","version":0,"site":"https://dokan-dev.github.io/","source":"Dokany Project","license_or_tos":"LGPL/MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
