Developing a device driver that works in kernel mode on windows is extremely technical. By using Dokan, you can create your own file systems very easily without writing device drivers. Dokan is similar to FUSE (Linux file system in user space) but works on Windows. Moreover, dokany includes a FUSE wrapper that helps you to port your FUSE filesystems without changes.\nThis is a minor version.\nThe installer will now prevent installation if the driver is already present. Several bug fixes address issues like memory leaks, crashes, and incorrect parameter handling In library. The most impactful change is the deletion semantics that now matches Microsoft expectations #883.\nLibrary breaking change: DOKAN_FILE_INFO.DeleteOnClose was renamed DOKAN_FILE_INFO.DeletePending. Same expectation (remove the object) but is set when last handle on the object is being closed #883.\nPlease see changelog for the other changes and more details.\nThanks to all the contributors as always !!! @uhonermann , @CookiePLMonster and others ...","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.3.0.1000","site":"https://dokan-dev.github.io/","source":"Dokany Project","license_or_tos":"LGPL/MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
