In the hope of modernizing AviSynth to meet present day needs and expectations, the project encourages everybody to help reach our goals: add long-sought features, energize the community, and improve developer and user friendliness. AviSynth+ is fully compatible with plugins and scripts written for AviSynth.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.7.3.4003","site":"https://avs-plus.net/","source":"The Public","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
