The upgrade to v5.6.4.0 Tricerat Licensing Server needs to be completed before upgrading any server session agent to avoid license checkout issues! See this page for upgrade instructions: Upgrading Your License Server All license server releases are backwards compatible with all previous V6 and v7 releases.\nVersion 7 products are not compatible with version 6 license activation codes. You will need new activation codes for version 7 products. Please contact your Salesperson for more information.\n\nImportant\nBefore installing any version 7 component, you may need to install the .NET 4.8 Runtime. Failure to do so will prevent license activation of a nodelocked license and all UIâ€™s will fail to run due to its dependency on this version of .NET. Note: Several Microsoft OS now include the .NET runtime so this step may not be required.\n\nImprovements and Fixes\n\n- ScrewDrivers Endpoint client - fixed bug when querying printer names and properties.\n- ScrewDrivers Printers - we now delay load allowed printer assignments for better initial UI performance.\n- ScrewDrivers Printers - fixed an issue when extending held or single queue print jobs.\n- Owner library - fixed an issue with local user assignments made by Screwdrivers Printers.\n- Other minor updates, fixes and logging improvements.\nKnown Issues\n\n- This version is in-compatible with Server 2012 R2 OS. Server 2012 R2 OS is still supported by previous versions.\n- If the ScrewDrivers Administration active tab is Reporting, the report viewer will hide portions of the File->Options or Help->About windows due to a technical limitation. A workaround does exist, just change to another tab view before displaying the File->Options or Help->About window. We do not expect this to be fixed in a future version.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.9.3","site":"https://www.tricerat.com/","source":"Tricerat","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
