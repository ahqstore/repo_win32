The upgrade to v5.6.4.0 Tricerat Licensing Server needs to be completed before upgrading any server session agent to avoid license checkout issues! See this page for upgrade instructions: Upgrading Your License Server All license server releases are backwards compatible with all previous V6 and v7 releases.\nVersion 7 products are not compatible with version 6 license activation codes. You will need new activation codes for version 7 products. Please contact your Salesperson for more information.\n\nImportant\nBefore installing any version 7 component, you may need to install the .NET 4.8 Runtime. Failure to do so will prevent license activation of a nodelocked license and all UIâ€™s will fail to run due to its dependency on this version of .NET. Note: Several Microsoft OS now include the .NET runtime so this step may not be required.\n\nImprovements and Fixes\n\n- ScrewDrivers Administration - fixed bug when custom owner names contain ' (apostrophe) character.\n- ScrewDrivers Advanced Print Feature - fixed several folder related issues.\n- ScrewDrivers Direct IP - fixed INF import not working with core drivers.\n- ScrewDrivers Printers - fixed several performance issues to speed up loading and filtering.\n- ScrewDrivers products now attempt to correct orphaned printers when services start.\n- ScrewDrivers macOS client installer now recognizes if Royal TSX is installed.\n- Other minor updates, fixes and logging improvements.\nKnown Issues\n\n- This version is in-compatible with Server 2012 R2 OS. Server 2012 R2 OS is still supported by previous versions.\n- If the ScrewDrivers Administration active tab is Reporting, the report viewer will hide portions of the File->Options or Help->About windows due to a technical limitation. A workaround does exist, just change to another tab view before displaying the File->Options or Help->About window. We do not expect this to be fixed in a future version.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.9.2.21272","site":"https://www.tricerat.com/","source":"Tricerat","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
