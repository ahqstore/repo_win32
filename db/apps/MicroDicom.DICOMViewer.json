Free software packages on the other side are often non-intuitive and with limited functionality. There is a common situation for the user when more than one package is needed to achieve feasible results.\nThe subject of the presented work is the design and implementation of a software package aimed to overcome the problem stated above. MicroDicom DICOM Viewer is equipped with most common tools for manipulation of DICOM images, and it has an intuitive user interface. It also has the advantage of being free for use and accessible to everyone.\nFeatures:\n- Open and save medical images in DICOM format\n- Read DICOM files of any manufacturer and modality\n- Supported DICOM images - without compression and RLE, JPEG Lossy, JPEG Lossless, JPEG 2000 Lossy, JPEG2000 Lossless compressions\n- Structured Reports\n- MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 transfer syntaxes\n- Encapsulated PDF\n- Open DICOM directory files\n- Display patient list from DICOMDIR\n- Load via drag & drop or double-click\n- Open images in common graphic formats (JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF)\n- Convert DICOM images to JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF\n- Convert DICOM images to movie file format(AVI, WMV and MP4)\n- Copy DICOM image to clipboard\n- Anonymize DICOM images\n- Image orientation in overlay\n- Mouse-driven level-window, user-defined window presets\n- Zooming and panning\n- Medical image processing operation\n- Measurements and annotations\n- Brightness/contrast control\n- Image resize, Rotate, Flip, Invert\n- Displaying DICOM attributes of selected image\n- Suited for patient CD/DVD to show DICOM images without installation\n- Run on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11\n- Available for x86 and x64 platforms\n- Portable version\n- And much more\n- New features:\n  Fusion PET-CT\n  Color maps\n  Added export button in Database view\n  DICOMDIR opening improvements\n  Improvements of DICOM image opening\n  Many stability improvements\n- Defect fixing:\n  Fixed some issue with download from DICOM server with some specific transfer syntaxes.\n  Fixed an issue with loading multi frame geometry data.\n  Fixed zooming have to take account pixel spacing when we do synchronization.\n  Remove applying pixel spacing when export to image, video and DICOM.\n  Fixed an issue with duplicate annotation on all images in the current series.\n  Fixed an issue with anonymize templates.\n  Fixed an issue with comparing patients with trailing and leading white space in the name.\n  Fixed a crash with reindex more than one studies in the database.\n  Fixed an issue about images with Rescale slope and intercept.\n  Fixed an issue with grayed item in Database view.\n  Fixed an issue with updating MPR combo box.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2025.2","site":"https://www.microdicom.com/","source":"MicroDicom","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
