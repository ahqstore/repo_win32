For rotating photos, most image editors decode the JPEG photo, rotate the bitmap and then re-encode it back to JPEG. This process decreases the final image quality. Unlike those tools, JPEG Lossless Rotator does not recode the images and instead performs a special lossless block transformation, which helps to preserve the quality of the images. In addition, JPEG Lossless Rotator has a simple multilingual interface and is very easy to use even for inexperienced computer users.\nCPU multithreading support to make operations with images much faster. Interface improvements and bugfixes: thumbnail selection via mouse dragging, retention of selection during scrolling.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"11.0","site":"https://annystudio.com/","source":"Anny","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
