This was causing common apps like Steam, Telegram, and more to initialize as floating instead of tiling correctly.\n🛠️️ Internal changes\n- Updated winget-releaser in Winget release workflow (#1098).\nBig thanks to @vikingnope for contributing to this release 💛\n/ @lars-berger","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.9.1","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/glzr-io","source":"Glzr Software Pte.
