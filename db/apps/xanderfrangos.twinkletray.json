(Thanks @marc-frank!)\n- SDR sliders will now display when HDR is the only supported brightness method, such as on HDR TVs. (Thanks @Kirin-0321!)\n- Updated localizations.\n- Updated dependencies.\nFixes:\n- Fixed window focus tracking not working.\n- Fixed errors displaying on the \"DDC/CI Features\" tab.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.17.2","version":0,"site":"https://twinkletray.com/","source":"Xander Frangos","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
