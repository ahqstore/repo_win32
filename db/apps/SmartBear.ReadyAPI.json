We are now moving into the final phase of deprecation of file-based licenses. Customers still using file-based licensing need to plan for migration to SLM before September 30, 2025.\nIf you are still in the process of migrating or have yet to start, contact your Account Manager or SmartBear representative today. Our teams are ready to assist with smooth transition strategies. For additional support, please log a request with our Customer Care Team, who are standing by to help.\nFor further information and timelines, please refer to this page.\nWelcome to the New ReadyAPI Documentation Experience\nWe have updated the ReadyAPI product documentation to provide a more streamlined and consistent user experience across our entire product portfolio. While retaining all essential information, the updated documentation features a fresh design that makes it easier to navigate, read, and utilize.\nThe new documentation experience offers several key benefits:\n- Enhanced panel structure and navigation: A reorganized layout for quicker, more intuitive access to content.\n- Improved search capabilities: Find information faster with a more powerful and precise search function.\n- Better usability: Simplified viewing and expanding of sections, making it easier to locate and understand relevant details.\nReadyAPI 3.59.0 includes a few changes compared to the previous product version â€“ ReadyAPI 3.58.0. For information on the changes made to other versions, see Version History.\nGit and Collaboration Enhancements\n- When performing git commit, if the user didn't make all the changes to the project, a notification is displayed saying that it is safe to commit because ReadyAPI modified all the files. This happens in the git commit and diff view panels.\n- Added a navigation panel to the git diff preview window. Users can now navigate through the changes made to a file using the Next and Previous buttons.\n- Improved the UX of the commit window, which now displays checkboxes to select which files to commit.\n- Updated icons in the git commit window.\nOther Enhancements\n- Updated the mechanism for copying and moving virtual actions to compare conditional match contents when performing an action. Prior to this change, only item names were compared and treated as duplicates.\n- You can configure Magic Strings using checkboxes to allow users to manage data types (boolean, empty strings, and numbers).\n- Updated the Slack integration to work with the latest Slack API.\n- Added the option to save the log created when copying or merging virtual actions to a file on the local machine.\n- Updated attachment encoding. This addresses issues with non-standard characters in filenames.\n- Users can log into SLM SaaS using a PKCE flow that uses the local system browser (instead of using the native ReadyAPI browser). This provides better support for the user's system and security configurations.\n- Basic support for webhooks has been added. Webhook entities are read-only and cannot be edited. This is part of a work program to add OAS 3.1 support in ReadyAPI planned for Q2 2025.\nGeneral Enhancements\n- Library Updates: ReadyAPI 3.59.0 includes newer versions of some libraries that version 3.58.0 used. If your scripts refer to classes from these libraries, you might need to update the scripts.\nPlease see here for a list of fixes included in this patch.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.59.0","site":"https://smartbear.com/","source":"SmartBear Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
