PuTTY implements the client end of that session: the end at which the session is displayed, rather than the end at which it runs.\nIn really simple terms: you run PuTTY on a Windows machine, and tell it to connect to (for example) a Unix machine. PuTTY opens a window. Then, anything you type into that window is sent straight to the Unix machine, and everything the Unix machine sends back is displayed in the window. So you can work on the Unix machine as if you were sitting at its console, while actually sitting somewhere else.\n- Support for ML-KEM, the NIST-standardised post-quantum key exchange mechanism. (In addition to NTRU Prime, which has been supported since 0.78.)\n- Support for full Unicode file names in Windows file selector dialogs. (However, these do not yet round-trip through a saved session.)\n- Bug fix: psftp -b works again.\n- Bug fix: assertion failure if an SSH connection times out at the login prompt.\n- Bug fix: crash in Pageant if an SSH connection is abandoned while waiting for a deferred decryption passphrase.\n- Bug fix: tight loop if PuTTY tried to send an empty answerback string.\n- Bug fix: accidental truncation of some configuration edit boxes' contents to 127 characters.\n- Bug fix: Windows XP support was accidentally broken, and now reinstated.\n- Bug fix: restored interoperation with third-party tools that auto-fill login prompts by sending ^M for Return.\n- Bug fix: confusion when terminal window resized by tools like FancyZones.\n- Bug fix: the small keypad keys didn't reliably work in the terminal on Unix.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.83.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/","source":"Simon Tatham","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
