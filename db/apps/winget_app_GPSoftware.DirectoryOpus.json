When combined with a keyword like OPENINDUAL this causes the target file display to become active. You can also use it with Go DRIVEBUTTONS=multifunc.\n- Added Toolbar command RELOAD argument; allows you to reload a currently open toolbar from disk (in case the disk file has changed).\n- Previously the Toolbar command's NAME field supported *this to mean the current toolbar only in conjunction with the CLOSE argument. This now works with other arguments (e.g. TOGGLE, RELOAD, etc) too.\n\nScripting\n- DialogListItem.subitems now returns a real object (DialogListSubItems) which is a collection of real objects (DialogListSubItem) rather than strings. Existing code should continue to work without needing modification.\n- The new DialogListSubItem script object has fg, bg and styles properties which allow colors and font styles to be specified for individual columns.\n- Added Filter.Load script method to load a saved filter.\n- Added TabStats properties expandeddirs, expandedcontents, selexpanded, checkedexpanded properties.\n- Single line and numeric edit fields in script dialogs have a new Enter property. When set to true, pressing the enter key in the field will no longer trigger the dialog's default button (if it has one) - instead, you'll receive an \"enter\" message in your script message loop.\n- Script commands can now return 1 from their command method to indicate they want to be called once for each selected file.\n\nEvaluator\n- The evaluator Rnd function will now return a different value each time it's called on a particular thread (previously it was only guaranteed to return a different value within the one piece of evaluation code). This means e.g. a rename function that uses {=Rnd()=} will get a different value for each file.\n- The evaluator Asc and Chr functions now support unicode surrogate pairs.\n\nMiscellaneous\n- Improvement to Synchronize folder exclusion lists. Excluded folders are now skipped even if they're inside other folders that don't exist in the destination.\n- Improved logic for naming new junctions/softlinks/etc. when there's already something with the same name.\n- Improved logic for Replace > Rename New, making it more strict when looking for and bumping \"(1)\" style counts on the end.\n- Aliases are now supported for Preferences / Miscellaneous / Advanced: [Behavior] everything_autolaunch.\n- If reading a network folder fails and the error isn't one that Opus recognises as meaning authentication is required, the error message now includes a Connect link that you can click to force Opus to request credentials. If the connection is successful the error code is added to the network_errors Advanced Preferences setting so that future failures will request authentication immediately.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"13.13","site":"https://www.gpsoft.com.au/","source":"GPSoftware","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
