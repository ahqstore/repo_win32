RSS records consecutive snapshots of the power in each of up to 512 frequency channels. Data can be shared in real time over the internet or saved to disk for review. RSS can be connected to a number of different software defined radios (SDRs) by utilizing the appropriate intermediary programs. While originally written to support the Radio JOVE project below 30 MHz, this software can be used at any frequency your radio supports.\nThis is an optional update\n\nThis update fixes a number of bugs, especially\nin the drawing routines.\n\n********Magnifier**********\nA magnifier option has been added and is available\nunder the View menu item. If you use this option,\nit may request that you install the dot Net platform.\nMost will probably have this. If for any reason\nyou wish not to install dot Net, don't use it.\nTo configure the magnifier, right click on it.\nTo capture a magnified image, point to it and\ntype Alt+X to freeze the image, then right click\non the image and select Save to a file or the\nClipboard. Press Alt-X again to unfreeze. The\nmagnifier is a seperate application and can be\nused without RSS.\n*******************************","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.9.80","version":0,"site":"https://radiosky.com/","source":"Radio-Sky Publishing","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
