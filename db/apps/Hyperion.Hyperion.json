It supports many LED devices and video grabbers.\nüåø Hyperion goes green!\nResource consumption during builds has been drastically reduced behind the scenes by streamlining processes and encouraging reuse.\nThis release also involves significant refactoring of the core elements of the platform and the API.\nThis version comes with many bug fixes and a number of long-awaited new features and improvements.\nYou can download the executables from GitHub or even better via our official repositories for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.\nInstallation and update instructions can be found on the comprehensive instructions page. Just select the method you would like to use.\n[!NOTE]\nThis release supersedes versions 2.1 and 2.1.0, which had some critical issues. Many thanks to those who shared their findings, and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.\nChange details\n‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes\n- Rename \"-v\" & \"--verbose\" options to \"-i\" & \"--info to not overlap with version information\nJSON-API\n- Standardized subscription update elements: ledcolors-imagestream-update, ledcolors-ledstream-update, and logmsg-update now return data under data instead of result.\n- Global configuration elements are now separated from instance-specific ones.\n\n‚ú® Added\n- Windows: Added a new grabber using DXGI DDA (Desktop Duplication API) for improved GPU-based performance.
