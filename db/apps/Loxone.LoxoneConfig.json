No other home automation software does the work for you like this, let alone for free. Just click and drag components – no coding and no complex programming required.\n\nAuto Configuration\nProgram basic functions like lighting or music all together in one click, all according to Loxone Standards & Recommendations. You also get full visualization with our free app for smartphones or tablets. From there, specific needs for customers can become implemented in hours – not days.\n\nSimulation & Live View\nBefore going live, you can fully test the configuration in Simulation Mode and preview how functions will deliver according to your project specifications.\nIn Live View you can see how the building operates remotely. No need to go on-site, you’ll always be able to check how the system is running no matter where you are.\n\nProject Planning\nGet ready for project planning and proposals to be created faster and easier than ever before. Helpful tools such as the ability to search and replace items makes it simple to navigate the best product selection for your project.\n\nProject Analysis\nThink “Spell Check” for your configuration. The Project Analysis feature reliably reviews your configuration as well as key points such as your password strength, unused objects or light circles, convertible objects and even offers help with statistics and data. Finish each configuration knowing you had a second set of eyes on your work!\n\nMultiplicator\nThe Loxone Multiplicator allows you to manage several Miniservers under one umbrella. For example, if a hotel has 30 rooms, each room has its own its own Miniserver, they can all be programmed and managed together under one project file – a multiplier file. You can create a multiplier file by selecting the project type or converting an existing project.\n\nFree updates\nOur software improves with every update. We continuously test and expand our software based on market feedback. We’re always exploring new features and functionality for all Loxone homes and buildings to come.\nFixed\nGeneral\n- BG-I37414: Improved automatic loading from Miniserver\n  - Only changed elements are loaded, not the whole program\n  - Open project remains mostly untouched\n  - If Miniserver project is newer, full reload still occurs\n- Property Window: Numeric editors did not show “different assignments”\n- Control drawing: Room/category misaligned in single-line mode\n- BG-I37367: Invalid action area on page corner\n\n- BG-I37436: Window FB WP not reacting to rising edge if Mld is higher\n- BG-I37381: Missing page tabs when loading with new Automatic Designer Rules\n- BG-I37015: User Management line jumps when changing group memberships\n- BG-I37493: Crash when deleting object while floating property window open\n- Property Window: Floating property window did not open when double clicking controls without a custom dialog\n- Invalid icons shown in some places\n- Floating property window does not close when selecting different control\n- Tooltip in property window shows in wrong place\n- Property Window: Linked function blocks dialog didn’t open for tracker reference on page\n- BG-I37504: Property Window: Audioplayer grouping dialog didn’t open\n- BG-I37517: Power Supply & Backup configuration dialog did not open after drag drop and on double click on function block\n\nAudio\n- BG-T3743 added command to clear caches (TTS, generated Event Sounds) via Admin Interface\n- Admin Interface ‘reset players’ fixed\n- fixed Bluetooth starts automatically after trigger Pulse on ‘Off’ Input\n- BG-I37444 some custom sound files weren’t played correctly (depends on mp3 rate & formats)\n- BG-I36836 fixed mute state for players being paused in Bluetooth and an event arrives\n- optimized LineIn latency\n- optimized audio sync parameters (sometimes acoustic jitters)\nClimate\n- BG-I37441: AC Unit Controller multiple similar messages in history\n- BG-I35097: Intelligent Roomcontroller showed heat demand in cooling mode\nMultiplicator\n- BG-I37375: Creating a page asked for settings that couldn’t be set\n- Editing of dialogs not workin\nStability\n- BG-I37442: Crash when editing filter after document switch\n- Miniserver reboot when receiving invalid HTTP chunks","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"16.0","version":0,"site":"https://www.loxone.com/","source":"Loxone Electronics GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
