Any app that already supports the existing dark and light modes will automatically benefit from Curtains. Stardock Curtains includes several new styles, like Crystal, Sky and Midnight. It also includes styles that let you change Windows to look like previous versions (XP, Windows 95, etc.) as well as alternative operating systems.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.19.1","site":"https://www.stardock.com","source":"Stardock Software, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
