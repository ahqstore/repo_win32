It scans the file system and learns about the files that were deleted, just as the free undelete tools. Then, it scans the hard drive directly to locate Microsoft Word documents that are not shown in the file system.

This method works even if your hard drive is half dead!\n\nDiskInternals Word Recovery support file system as exFAT, NTFS, Ext2/3/4, ReiserFS, XFS, FAT, ReFS, UFS, HFS, RomFS(reader), Reiser4.\n\nDiskInternals Word Recovery synchronizes the results obtained with the scan of the file system with the results obtained by accessing the hard disk directly, presenting the complete list of recoverable Word documents along with their file names and contents, and yields the best ratio of recoverability.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.20.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.diskinternals.com/","source":"DiskInternals Research","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
