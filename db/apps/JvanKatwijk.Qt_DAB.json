One had to do with the auto\nhttp setting. In many cases that the auto http was \"on\", starting the program just created a crash.\nThe other had to do with an occasional buffer overflow.\nAnyway, in the current version some cleaning up was done and next to fixing these errors some issues\nin the packet handling (for EPG/SPI) were solved.\n\nSince apparently not in all PC''s there is a CPU that supports avx2 instructions, so there are two\nversions made, one using the avx2 instructions and one that does not.\n\nThe documentation is updated for 696.\nMost visible changes are in the configuration and control window, some settings were removed and\nsome settings were added.\nOne of the changes invisible in the GUI, is the way slides are saved, now within a directory labeled\nwith the Eid in a subdirectory labeled with the service name\n\nAs always, comments are welcome, One request though: if there is an issue, please specify version and\nplatform","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.9.6","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/","source":"JvanKatwijk","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
