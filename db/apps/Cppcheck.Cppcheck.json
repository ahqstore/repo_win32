Unlike C/C++ compilers and many other analysis tools it does not detect syntax errors in the code. Cppcheck primarily detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally do not detect. The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have zero false positives).\nRelease Notes for Cppcheck 2.19\nMajor bug fixes & crashes:\n- Crash in CheckClass::checkConst()\n- fuzzing crash (assert) in Token::update_property_info()\n- Crash in checkConstVariable()\n- Crash in valueFlowLifetimeClassConstructor()\n- GUI: scratch pad crash\n- Assert failure in getParentValueTypes()\n- Crash in simplecpp::Macro::expand()\n- crash in Tokenizer::simplifyCPPAttribute()\nNew checks:\n- Detect zero initialization of unions in which its largest member is not\n  declared as the first one. Depending on the compiler, there's no guarantee\n  that the complete union will be zero initialized in such scenarios leading to\n  potential access of uninitialized memory.\n- Added warning when main() throws an exception\nC/C++ support:\n- Fixed syntax error for C++23 lambda without parameter clause\n- Added support for typeof and __typeof operators\nGUI:\n- Fix bug: checks multiple configurations even though user provides defines\nChanged interface:\n- some preprocessorErrorDirective and syntaxError errors got more specific error IDs.\n- Removed deprecated platforms unix32-unsigned and unix64-unsigned\n- Improve progress value\n- Added float bits support in platform configuration\n- Fixed --showtime not accounting for addons\nPerformance:\n- Introduced cache for followAllReferences() calls\nInfrastructure & dependencies:\n- Removed deprecated support for builds with Qt5.\n- Added make variables CXXOPTS and LDOPTS to extend existing CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.\n- Added make variables CPPOPTS to extend existing CPPFLAGS.\n- CPPFLAGS are not longer being passed to the linker command for cppcheck and testrunner.\n- Updated Qt to 6.10.0 (official Windows release only).\n- The official Windows binary is now built against Boost 1.89 for increased performance.\n- Updated to simplecpp 1.6.2\n- The Visual Studio builds not longer set the WIN32 define.\n- Added DISALLOW_PROCESS_EXECUTOR for building without fork().\nThe changes focus heavily on stability (crash fixes), C/C++ compatibility, reducing false positives, and improving performance.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.19.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/danmar","source":"The Cppcheck team","license_or_tos":"GPL 3 or later","resources":null,"verified":false}
