It's designed to be a full-featured alternative to NSSM, WinSW, and FireDaemon Pro.\n\nServy is digitally signed using a trusted code-signing certificate provided by the SignPath Foundation. This ensures that all Servy executables and installers are verified and secure, giving you peace of mind when using the tool.\n\nServy offers a desktop app, a CLI, and a PowerShell module that let you create, configure, and manage Windows services interactively or through scripts and CI/CD pipelines. It also includes a Manager app for easily monitoring and managing all installed services in real time.\n\nFeatures:\n- Clean, simple UI\n- Monitor and manage all installed services with Servy Manager\n- Real-time CPU and RAM monitoring with live performance graphs for installed services\n- CLI and PowerShell module for full scripting and automated deployments\n- Run any executable as a Windows service\n- Set service name, description, startup type, priority, working directory, environment variables, dependencies, and parameters\n- Environment variable expansion supported in both environment variables and process parameters\n- Run services as Local System, local or domain accounts, Active Directory accounts, or gMSAs\n- Redirect stdout/stderr to log files with automatic size-based and date-based rotations\n- Run pre-launch hook before starting the service, with retries, timeout, logging and failure handling\n- Run post-launch hook after the application starts successfully\n- Supports Ctrl+C for command-line apps, close-window for GUI apps, and force kill if unresponsive\n- Prevent orphaned/zombie processes with improved lifecycle management and ensuring resource cleanup\n- Health checks and automatic service recovery\n- Browse and search logs by level, date, and keyword for faster troubleshooting from Servy Manager\n- Export/Import service configurations\n- Service Event Notification alerts on service failures via Windows notifications and email\n- Compatible with Windows 7-11 x64 and Windows Server editions\n\nWho is it for?\n- Developers: Run development servers, scripts, or custom tools as services without extra setup.\n- Sysadmins & IT professionals: Ensure critical background processes stay alive, monitored, and properly logged.\n- Teams or organizations: Automate background services reliably across multiple machines.\n- feat(psm1): make Servy PowerShell module fully compatible with PowerShell 2.0+\n- feat(psm1): ensure Servy PowerShell module compatibility with Windows 7+ and Windows Server 2008+\n- fix(psm1): resolve servy-cli.exe path relative to module for portable and SCCM (#31)\n- fix(psm1): correct validation for -StartupType and -DateRotationType parameters for Install-ServyService function\n- fix(psm1): replace exit statements with throw for proper PowerShell error handling\n- fix(psm1): throw error when cli exits with non-zero exit code\n- fix(psm1): add validation to help command\n- fix(cli): return exit code 0 for help and version commands instead of 1\n- fix(manager): increase performance graph grid thickness for pixel-perfect visibility\n- refactor(psm1): dry up code and improve error handling\n- chore(deps): update dependencies\n- chore(core): remove unused dependency System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter\n- docs(psm1): clarify module usage for installed and portable Servy versions (#31)\n- docs(wiki): update Export/Import and PowerShell docs","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.3","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/aelassas","source":"Akram El Assas","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
