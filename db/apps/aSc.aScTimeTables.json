And if a manic colleague or headmaster comes with new request - no problem. The work takes just 5 minutes again, instead of days.\nSubstitution\nManage your substitutions online. Once the timetable has been created, you just need to input the absentees. aSc Substitutions will advise the best cover teacher - but you are free to choose your own candidate.

You just pick the lesson’s topic from your teaching plan and check the students’ attendance. The boring administration has changed into a useful function.

They can help them with more difficult topics.\nCalendar\nTeachers or admin can add school events such as discussions, excursions, or school holidays in a common school calendar. It is linked to the class register.\nRoom or event booking\nIt is easy to book a room or teachers' meeting ad hoc. The system combines up-to-date information from timetables, absent teacher covers, and events. It finds the most suitable room for your meeting at a time convenient for all attendees.
