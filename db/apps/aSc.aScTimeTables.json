And if a manic colleague or headmaster comes with new request - no problem. The work takes just 5 minutes again, instead of days.\nSubstitution\nManage your substitutions online. Once the timetable has been created, you just need to input the absentees. aSc Substitutions will advise the best cover teacher - but you are free to choose your own candidate. Besides being published on the website and mobile phones, all changes are automatically entered in class registers and calendars.\nShare timetable and substitution\nMake the school timetable available to teachers, students and parents. aSc Substitutions notifies them about daily substitution changes that are relevant to them personally.\nMobile application\naSc TimeTables mobile application allows you to effectively do things which were practically impossible to do without one.

You just pick the lesson’s topic from your teaching plan and check the students’ attendance. The boring administration has changed into a useful function. The parents are better informed about what their children have learnt. They can help them with more difficult topics.\nCalendar\nTeachers or admin can add school events such as discussions, excursions, or school holidays in a common school calendar. It is linked to the class register.\nRoom or event booking\nIt is easy to book a room or teachers' meeting ad hoc. The system combines up-to-date information from timetables, absent teacher covers, and events. It finds the most suitable room for your meeting at a time convenient for all attendees. The booking is immediately displayed in the timetable and in the attendees’ class register. All attendees are instantly notified. A room can also be booked directly in the class register.
