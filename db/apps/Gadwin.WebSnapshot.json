The captured image can then be edited, resized and annotated before being output to a graphical file.  The application also gives you the option of sending the Web capture directly to your printer or as an email, and it will even automatically resize the picture to specified dimensions.\nGadwin Web Snapshot is very easy to use, the interface is intuitive, and once you have it set up the way you like it, you never have to look at it at all.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.6","site":"https://www.gadwin.com/","source":"Gadwin Systems, Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
