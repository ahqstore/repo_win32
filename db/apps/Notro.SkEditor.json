And I'm still returning to you with only a small update :(\nI'm working on a lot of things right now. @GliczDev is also busy working on the new Analyzer. I hope everything will start to roll out in a few months!\nI spent most of my time in recent weeks (or even months) thinking, planning, prototyping, adding, and testing things related to SkEditor. From the user perspective, it might seem that I didn't do much, but, well, I hope you believe me!\nI want to dedicate a little time from SkEditor to my other projects, though. I've been working on it like it's my full-time job (without the full-time job benefits...) and couldn't work on my other projects because of that. If I continue at this pace, I'll probably burn out completely and stop working on SkEditor altogether...\nAI Copilot\nBy the way, I don't know if you're active on our Discord server - but there was a poll about features users would like to see the most and earliest, and AI Copilot won with 36% of votes. According to WakaTime, I've already spent 70 hours working on it! There's still a lot to fix, improve, and add. I plan to send testing versions to select users so I can gather feedback too.\nChanges\n- Changed the titlebar layout a little bit\n- Changed the sidebar layout and icon behavior\n- Fixed opening network folders (SMB share) (fixes #144)\n- Added Custom UI Scale option to the settings.json\n- Updated the ICO file to include multiple resolutions\n- Added \"Dev tools\" menu with syntax and theme reload features\n- Removed the check for outdated addons\n- Updated libraries\n🎉 Enjoy!\n📄 File Descriptions\n────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFile                    │Description\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n💻 SkEditorInstaller.msi│Quick, easy installation for Windows x64 (most common)\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📦 Windows-x64.zip      │Portable Windows version for x64 chips (likely your version)\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n📦 Windows-arm64.zip    │Portable Windows for ARM64 (only for ARM devices)\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n🐧 Linux-x64.zip        │Portable Linux x64 version\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n🍎 macOS-x64.zip        │For macOS on x64 (Intel chips)\n────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n🍏 macOS-arm64.zip      │For macOS on ARM64\n────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n> 📝 Note: macOS installation requires extra steps.
