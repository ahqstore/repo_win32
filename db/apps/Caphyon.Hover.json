We all use PowerShell, but it is unproductive to repeat long commands, so we built a tool that saves your time.\n\nHover is included in the “Tools“ section of PacKit. From its GUI you can select the target app container and from the right side pane double click the program you want to launch in the container.\n\nYou can also add new programs to that list, we've just included a predefined list for the most used.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.2.0","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Caphyon","license_or_tos":"MIT License","resources":null,"verified":false}
