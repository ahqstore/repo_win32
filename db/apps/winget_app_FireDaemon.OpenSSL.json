It implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, which are widely used to encrypt data transmissions between web servers and clients, such as web browsers. OpenSSL provides a wide range of cryptographic functions, including symmetric encryption, public-key encryption, message digest and hash functions, digital signatures, and random number generation. It supports a large number of cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, RSA, SHA, and many others. In addition to cryptographic functions, OpenSSL also provides utilities for generating and managing digital certificates and keys, creating and verifying digital signatures, and performing SSL/TLS handshake and negotiation.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.4.0","site":"https://www.firedaemon.com/","source":"FireDaemon Technologies Limited","license_or_tos":"Apache License v2","resources":null,"verified":false}
