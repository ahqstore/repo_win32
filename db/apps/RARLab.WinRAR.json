By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disk space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.\n- WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).\n- WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.\n- WinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks.\n- WinRAR is also ideal if you are sending data through the web. Its AES 256-bit encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.\n- WinRAR is a trial product, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days!\n- WinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.\n1. \"Settings/General\" dialog page is split to \"Settings/Interface\"\n      and \"Settings/System\" pages. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs\n      instead of horizontal.\n\n   2. WinRAR sets the dark interface mode if \"Color mode\" option\n      in \"Settings/Interface\" is set to \"Dark\". This option can enable\n      dark and light modes unconditionally or use Windows color mode settings.\n\n   3. \"Large memory pages\" option in \"Settings/System\" dialog and -mlp\n      command line switch enable using 2 MB memory pages instead of\n      default 4 KB, when allocating large memory areas in RAR archive\n      format compression and extraction routines.\n\n      It allows to improve archiving and, in some cases, extraction speed.\n      Typically the performance gain is more significant for bigger\n      compression dictionaries and slower compression methods.\n\n      This feature requires \"Lock pages in memory\" privilege\n      and if it is missing, WinRAR proposes to assign it to the current\n      user account, making it available for other software too.\n      Windows restart is necessary to activate the newly assigned privilege.\n\n   4. \"Zone value only\" option in \"Settings/Security\" dialog controls\n      if archive Mark of the Web propagation includes only the security zone\n      value or all available fields.\n\n      While additional fields, such as a download location or IP address,\n      might help to identify a file source, they can be a privacy concern\n      if file is shared with other persons.\n\n   5. Switch -om[-|1][=list] controls Mark of the Web propagation\n      in WinRAR and console RAR command line mode.\n\n   6. Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows are not supported anymore.\n      WinRAR requires Windows 7 x64 or later.\n\n      Unlike WinRAR, 32-bit self-extracting modules are still provided\n      as a part of 64-bit installation package.\n\n   7. \"Auto\", \"Always on\" and \"Disable\" choices are now available\n      for \"Delta compression\" and \"Executable compression\" options\n      in \"Advanced compression parameters\" dialog.\n\n      To improve the compression speed, \"Auto\" applies these options\n      depending on the compression method, such as disabling them\n      for \"Fastest\" and \"Fast\" methods. Use \"Always on\" to enable them\n      for all methods.\n\n   8. Name of environment variable to store the default set of RAR switches\n      is changed from \"RAR\" to \"RARINISWITCHES\". It is rather typical\n      for batch scripts to use \"RAR\" environment variable name to store\n      RAR executable pathname, which led to the name conflict previously.\n\n   9. \"Completion message title\" and \"Completion message text\" options\n      on \"Text\" page of \"Advanced SFX options\" dialog allow to define\n      a custom message displayed on the successful completion of SFX archive\n      extraction.\n\n      This message can also be added with \"TextDone\" script command.\n\n      SFX logo and icon options are moved to the new \"Logo and icon\" page\n      of \"Advanced SFX options\" dialog. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs\n      instead of horizontal.\n\n  10. Windows 11 context menu:\n\n      a) compression profiles in the new context menu are placed above\n         extraction commands, similarly to the legacy context menu;\n\n      b) separator lines are inserted between archive open, extraction\n         and archiving command groups.\n\n  11. When extracting a file with NTFS \"Compressed\" attribute,\n      this attribute is assigned in the beginning of file extraction.\n      Typically it reduces the extraction time compared to assigning it\n      after writing the file data.\n\n  12. When adding files to existing RAR archive, folders previously stored\n      in such archive are moved to a position after newly added files.\n      So folder timestamps are set after extracting all files and are not\n      modified when creating files inside of these folders.\n\n  13. Temporary file isn't created anymore for \"rar ch -tl\" command if other\n      switches or archive parameters do not imply the archive modification.\n      Modification time of newest archived file is set directly to original\n      archive file, without copying the archive data. It reduces disk write\n      and processing time.\n\n  14. If archive is truncated at recovery record or quick open information\n      service blocks, the additional message with truncated block type\n      is displayed after the standard \"Unexpected end of archive\".\n\n  15. RAR compression algorithm can use multiple Windows processor groups\n      to utilize up to maximum supported 64 logical processors.\n      It can improve RAR compression speed on systems with logical\n      processors number exceeding 64 and not multiple of 64.\n\n      Previously the maximum number of logical processors was limited\n      to a single processor group size, such as 36 for 72 processors.\n\n  16. Additionally to size, a percent of archive size is also displayed\n      for recovery record in \"Show information\" command.\n\n      For RAR 5.0 archives it is the exact value specified when creating\n      the recovery record. For older RAR formats it is the approximate value\n      calculated from the available data.\n\n  17. When opening a nested archive from another archive opened in WinRAR,\n      Mark of the Web data will be assigned to nested archive unless\n      \"Propagate Mark of the Web\" option in WinRAR \"Settings/Integration\"\n      is set to \"Never\". Previously it was assigned only if this option\n      was set to \"For all files\" or to \"For user defined files\" and list\n      of user defined files included the archive extension.\n\n      Also \"For office files\" and \"For executable and office files\" lists\n      now include popular archive extensions supported by WinRAR.\n\n      Assigning Mark of the Web data to nested archives allows to propagate\n      it to files extracted from such archives, which wasn't done by default\n      in previous versions.\n\n      We are thankful to Qize Wang (ADLab of VenusTech) for bringing this\n      issue to our attention.\n\n  18. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) if new files have been added to existing semi-solid RAR archive\n         created with -se or -s switches, such files could be damaged.\n         This issue doesn't affect usual solid archives created with -s,\n         also as non-solid archives;\n\n      b) even though the long range search isn't used with -m1 \"fastest\"\n         compression method, switches -m1 -mcl+ or -m1 -mcl with 256MB\n         or larger compression dictionary still allocated memory required\n         for long range search algorithm;\n\n      c) if \"Remove redundant folders from extraction path\" option was on\n         when extracting a file from archive subfolder, clicking on \"..\"\n         in the file list afterwards displayed the folder with the archive\n         file instead of parent folder inside of archive;\n\n      d) if application was started from archive and created multiple files\n         with monotonically growing date, WinRAR could issue archive update\n         prompts for every created file instead of a single prompt.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.10.0","site":"https://www.rarlab.com/","source":"win.rar GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
