By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disk space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.\n- WinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).\n- WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.\n- WinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks.\n- WinRAR is also ideal if you are sending data through the web. Its AES 256-bit encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.\n- WinRAR is a trial product, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days!\n- WinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.\n1. If \"Add to archive...\" Explorer context menu command is applied to\n     multiple archives in the disk root, for example, d:\\arc1.rar\n     and d:\\arc2.rar, WinRAR will propose arc1_rar.rar default name\n     for a new archive. Previous version proposed arc1.rar, updating one\n     of selected archives instead of creating a new one.\n\n  2. Bugs fixed:\n\n     a) WinRAR 7.10 failed to update solid archives containing a folder\n        record placed before a file record. It issued the checksum error\n        message and aborted processing.\n\n        As a result of this fix, this version preserves the original position\n        of such folders after updating and doesn't move them to the end\n        of archive as WinRAR 7.10 did;\n\n     b) when extracting a file from CAB archive over an existing file,\n        existing files were overwritten, but not truncated.\n        So if existing file was larger than extracted, existing file data\n        had been left at the end of the extracted file;\n\n     c) if SFX module from \"Advanced SFX options\" dialog was stored\n        in the compression profile, it was applied as is, even if archive\n        format was changed after selecting the profile. It could result\n        in SFX module mismatching the archive format;\n\n     d) choosing a value in bytes from drop down list associated\n        with archive dialog \"Split to volumes, size\" field didn't set\n        units to bytes automatically;\n\n     e) if SFX \"TextDone\" command was used together with \"Silent\"\n        and \"TempMode\" commands, the completion message was sometimes\n        displayed behind other opened windows;\n\n     f) if symlink pointing at an executable was started from WinRAR shell,\n        the executable Mark of the Web data was ignored. We are thankful\n        to Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc\n        for reporting this issue.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"7.11.0","site":"https://www.rarlab.com/","source":"win.rar GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
