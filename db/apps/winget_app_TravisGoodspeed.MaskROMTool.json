Gatorom's solver-set option now uses descriptive filenames.\n2. GUI can now export a set of solved results with File/Export/SolverSetBytes.\n3. Clearer selection rectangle.\n4. R and C will now draw the correct line type when the user confuses them.\n5. ^H now sets the home position.\n6. Zooming and movement keys now work in the second view.\n7.
