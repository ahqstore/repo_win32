This release has no functional changes beyond a few small bug fixes. This release includes minor breaking changes to ABI (binary interface) and API (source interface) to remove some deprecated functions, improve efficiency, and set the stage for future enhancements. Most code will not be affected, and all the changes have easy fixes that are documented in the release notes. If you are updating your code from a version earlier than 10.6.0, you will have to deal with the PointerHolder transition. If you ran version 11 and are already setting POINTERHOLDER_TRANSITION to 4, you can remove that. A full discussion can be found in the manual in the Smart Pointers section. This version of qpdf still builds with C++-17 compiler, but we will be switching the minimum version to C++-20 soon, but no earlier than April 2025.\nFor a full list of changes from previous releases, please see the release notes. See also README-what-to-download for details about the available source and binary distributions.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"12.0.0","site":"https://github.com/qpdf","source":"QPDF","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
