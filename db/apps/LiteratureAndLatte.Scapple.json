Then join them up in any way you like.\n\nScapple is an easy-to-use tool for getting ideas down as quickly as possible and making connections between them. Itâ€™s the software equivalent of taking a large piece of paper and writing your thoughts and ideas all over it, in no particular order, perhaps clustering related notes and drawing lines and arrows between them as connections become apparent.\nRefinements and Changes\n- Updated the in-app store.\n- Improved drag and drop from Scrivener to work with multiple selections.\n- Enabled the title bar to adapt to the Windows dark or light mode Color setting.\n- Corrected text in an activation error message.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4.2.0","site":"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/","source":"Literature and Latte Ltd.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
