The updated pipeline should provide users with a list of versions and the changelog summary for each of them. The summary is auto-generated by an LLM from full changelog as a part of the release pipeline. I hope to extend it at some point to other stores that support displaying changelogs.\nI've also turned on GitHub's immutable releases.\nAll changes\n- 9bd9ef43 - chore: Remove extra whitespace from command preventing that from running\n- 5a4c0455 - chore: Comply with actions/checkout requiring path to be under the predefined checkout dir\n- cfe5ce46 - chore: Bump app version name to 2.1.0\n- 4a852279 - feat(Android): Initial support for the Create password credential request #1191\n- a2cb2fa2 - chore: Create an GitHub issue for publishing on Flathub for tracking\n- 88c13054 - chore(Flatpak): Maintain the releases list automatically + generate release summary\n- c87130fc - chore: Update Flathub listing accroding to the platform guidelines\n- 0c7ea794 - Merge pull request #1188 from AChep/dependabot/github_actions/actions/upload-artifact-6\n- 011f713c - build(deps): Bump actions/upload-artifact from 4 to 6\n- 3aae1333 - docs(Readme): Remove AUR package instructions\n- b2436d45 - docs(Readme): Resize Flathub badge image to match the others\n- dcdd3700 - docs(Readme): Add a link to Flathub","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.1.0","version":0,"site":"https://artemchep.com/","source":"Unknown","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
