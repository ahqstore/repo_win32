It protects your photos, music, documents and any other data from being lost due to a hard drive crash, virus attack or accidental deletion. The program should be especially useful for anyone who has several storage drives (it could be several hard drives installed on one PC or several PCs networked together).\n\n- You can specify file groups to back up, such as IE favorites or Windows mail contacts, or select individual folders to back up under each profile you create.\n- By creating separate profiles, you can set individual rules for backing up different folders and file groups depending on how frequently you use or modify them.\n- To avoid wasting valuable disk space, you can select to back up only the files that have changed since the last backup or files that have changed since the last FULL backup.\n- Choose a cloud storage system youâ€™d like to use and set up BitReplica to save your backups there. This way you will be able to access your files from anywhere you may be and be sure the files are stored in a safe place.\n- Create your backups manually whenever it is convenient for you, or set them to be created automatically on an hourly, daily or weekly schedule. Specify your preference under each profile.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.6.0.2","site":"https://www.auslogics.com/en/about/","source":"Auslogics","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
