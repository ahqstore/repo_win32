Bisq uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a third party. Bisq is non-custodial and incorporates a human arbitration system to resolve disputes.\nSome users aren't getting enough connections to the bitcoin network and can't therefore broadcast transactions. This hot-fix release resolves these connectivity issues and improves the reliability of the network.\nSee https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/87?closed=1 for more details.\n\nCredits\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n- @alejandrogarcia83\n- @alvasw\n- @devinbileck\n- @Emzy\n- @gabernard\n- @HenrikJannsen\n- @jmacxx\n- @stejbac\n- @wiz\nA special thanks to our first time contributors:\n- @runbtc\nAs well as to everyone that helped with translations on Transifex.\nhttps://transifex.com/bisq/bisq-desktop","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.9.18","site":"https://bisq.network/","source":"Bisq","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
