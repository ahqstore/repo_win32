No longer hammers all subsongs when starting playback.\n- Default User Interface: made cycling tabs by keyboard shortcuts cancel tab rename in progress.\n- Converter: Made \"no DSP reset\" explicitly shown in overview, as it's dangerous if enabled unintentionally.\n- Fixed various regressions with network shares in Media Library preferences page.\n- File Operations: Fixed error with renaming files on redirected portable music folders.\n- Fixed tag writing issues on fragmented/streaming M4A/MP4 files.\n- Fixed bugs related to copy-paste of file-relative locations in portable installs.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.25.4","version":0,"site":"https://perkele.cc/","source":"Peter Pawlowski","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
