While primarily intended for HVAC building applications, the program can be used for other types of economic studies as well.\nEngineering Economic Analysis v3.1 contains the following changes:\n- Implemented a new project management system. Each project is stored in a single file that can be placed anywhere and moved or renamed at any time. The program remembers the location of project files and displays them on a ‘most recently used projects’ list.\n- Implemented a new software security scheme using a license key. The license key is issued when you first license the software and expires when the license expires. A new key is provided each time you renew the license to extend operation for another year. Note that the license key is associated with your license, not a particular version of the software.\n- Implemented a new installation approach. Version 3.1 installs as a standalone software program.\n  Installation of Carrier X Builder Framework is no longer required.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1","version":0,"site":"https://www.carrier.com/commercial/","source":"Carrier","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
