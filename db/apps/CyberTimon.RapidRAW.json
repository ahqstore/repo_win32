It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nRapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a clean, fast, and simple workflow. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.\n\nIt is not for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.\n\nRapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!\nCommunity Presets Sharing\nI wanted to create a place where people can share presets with each other, so I've added a new Community Presets page. To get things started, I've already shared 7 of my own. I'm looking forward to seeing what you all come up with.\nTo submit your own preset, please follow the submission guide located at the bottom of the Community Presets page.\nHere is the direct link to the submission issue: Submit Your Preset (you need to have this version installed)\nGenerative AI Improvements\nThis release includes a new ComfyUI workflow that handles high-quality inpainting much better. The results should now be nearly the same resolution as the original image. The installation for the workflow is also simpler, now requiring only one custom ComfyUI node.\nI've also adjusted the UI to better align with the project's AI Roadmap. This includes a placeholder for a planned future cloud service, which would be an option for those who don't have the hardware to self-host or prefer not to set it up themselves (not paywalling features).\nIf you have any ideas or feedback on the AI roadmap, feel free to let me know.\n- Upgrading to this version will reset the app’s settings & comfyui config (your edits will not be affected).","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.3.13","site":"https://github.com/CyberTimon","source":"Timon Käch","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
