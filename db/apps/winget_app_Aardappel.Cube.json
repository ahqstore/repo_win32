Cube is a landscape-style engine that pretends to be an indoor FPS engine, which combines very high precision dynamic occlusion culling with a form of geometric mipmapping on the whole world for dynamic LOD for configurable fps & graphic detail on most machines. Uses OpenGL & SDL.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2005.08.29","site":null,"source":"Aardappel","license_or_tos":"zlib","resources":null,"verified":false}
