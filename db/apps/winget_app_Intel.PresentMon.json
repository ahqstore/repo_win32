The Displayed FPS metric now tracks both application and generated frames in the FPS calculation. In addition PresentMon will report the type of frame using the FrameType metric.\n- Added support for Intel XeLL and introduced a new metric called Instrumented Latency, which uses driver-based markers to accurately represent latency from frame start to when the frame is on the display.\n- Added ability to configure service logging via registry\n- Added Animation Time metric which is the time the CPU started animation work on a frame\n\nBug Fixes\n- Fixed issue where PresentMon would fail initialization the first time it is run after reboot\n- Improved accuracy of VRAM Read/Write bandwidth metrics on BMG","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2.3.0.0","site":"https://www.intel.com/","source":"Intel(R) Corporation","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
