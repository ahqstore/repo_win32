It is also very helpful for educational training.\nPVsyst focuses on complete and precise PV system study with a complete set of tools.\n* Improvements\n\n- Databases update\n- Tutorial: new PDF tutorials were added: Step by step, \"Standalone\" and \"Pumping\".\n\n* Corrections\n\n- Module layout: fixed issue impacting intermediate results in cases where the PV array yields no power due to a combination of shadings and inverter operating constraints\n- Storage, power shifting: fixed issue triggering warning for energy balance error in  versions 8.0.18 and 8.0.19\n- Weather data: tables and graphs of variable \"Global tilted plane\" now properly account for the chosen albedo factor.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"8.0.20","version":0,"site":"https://www.pvsyst.com/","source":"PVsyst SA","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
