This option can also now be used on plain text links.\n- Linux binaries are now provided in XZ format, replacing the previous BZ2 format, offering faster unpacking and smaller file sizes. Blog Post\n- Some web pages either function as redirects or abuse the history API in order to generate an excessive amount of history entries. Both cases can result in making navigating your browser history via the back/forward buttons annoyingly difficult. This intervention causes these history entries which the user has not interacted with to be skipped by the back and forward buttons.\nDeveloper\n\nWeb Platform\n- The attribute values which indicate the coordinates of PointerEvent may now be fractional values rather than only integers. This allows web apps to handle the events with higher-precision coordinates when the target element is transitioned by CSS and/or the viewport is zoomed.\n- The behavior of mouseenter, mouseleave, pointerenter and pointerleave events was changed for improved spec compliance when the last mouseover or pointerover event target is removed.\n- Added support for the WebAuthn getClientCapabilities() method.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"135.0","site":"https://www.mozilla.org/","source":"Mozilla","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
