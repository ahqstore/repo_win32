There are also snapcraft packages, that may however be outdated.\nMacOS:\nWe provide packages for Intel x86_64 and ARM (Apple Silicon).\n- ARM: built on Sonoma 14.4 using Qt 6.7.2\n- Intel: built on Monterey 12.6.3 using Qt 5.15.2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.4.14","version":0,"site":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:HG","source":"Wikimedia Project","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
