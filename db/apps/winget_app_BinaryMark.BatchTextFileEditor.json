RegEx support with colored syntax highlighting and RegEx match substitutions. Multi-line replace lets you search for and replace text spanning multiple lines. Wildcards, case sensitivity, and match counting options can refine your search! Insert new text at specified line number, character position. Delete, copy, and move specified text blocks. Includes complete Unicode and RegEx support. RegEx pattern builder will help you design and test regular expressions right within the program. Specialized RegEx tools like html/xml tag selector, line selector, or number selector make it easier to create RegEx patterns. Perform multiple replacements easily by entering search-replace pairs into grid or import them from a file. Program has complete Unicode support. Process 1000s of files using multiple CPU cores in manual, automatic/continuous, triggered/scheduled, or console modes, or directly from Windows Explorer right-click menu. Save files to output directory specified using either absolute or relative path, with original or new name defined by a mask. Select files for processing based on their name, dates, size, and contents using advanced file search supporting RegEx and advanced wildcards. Optionally merge together, split all, or zip processed files. Perform different operations on different files with conditional processing and process branching.
