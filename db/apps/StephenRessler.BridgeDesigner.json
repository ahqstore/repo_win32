Learn about engineering. Change the world.\n\nThe Bridge Designer is a free educational software package designed to provide middle-school and high-school students with a realistic introduction to engineering through the design of a highway truss bridge. The winner of two major national awards for educational software development, the Bridge Designer has the “look and feel” of the computer-aided design (CAD) packages used by practicing engineers but is much easier to use. It can be installed on either Windows or Mac computers.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.16.125","version":0,"site":"https://stephenjressler.com/","source":"Stephen Ressler","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
