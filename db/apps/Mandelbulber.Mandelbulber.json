The keyframe without a value (empty cell) will be interpolated.\n- Examples: Updated most examples to be more attractive and to use new features. Added new examples.\n- Shaders: Global illumination uses material reflectance information.\n- Shaders: The size parameter defines the diameter of the tip of the conical light.\n- UI: Added an option to disable Monte Carlo effects in the Navigator.\n- UI: Added a temporary image scale (just below RENDER button)\n- Navigator: Added the possibility to use the Navigator from the Objects dock.\n- Primitives: Added a wall thickness parameter to all primitives.\n- Primitives: Added an ellipsoid primitive.\n- Scripts: Corrected the saving of scripts. They were not saved if the output value was default.\n- Fixed an error in transf_de_linear_cube.ui. It caused the application to crash when the UI formula was selected.\n- Fixed an error in normal vector calculation.\n- Fixed a bug: when fractalize texture was used, there was an error in OpenCL fast mode.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"2.33","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/buddhi1980","source":"Mandelbulber Team","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
