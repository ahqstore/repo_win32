Navigate to Preferences > Conflict Detection to set the preffered branches for a repository.\n  - This feature is currently in preview and may undergo significant updates based on feedback. Share your thoughts with us to help shape its future direction!\n- Custom External Editors\n  - You can now set any external editor for GitKraken to use when opening files or repositories.\n  - Navigate to Preferences > External Tools to set the default external editor to <Custom> and enter the path for the editor you want to use. If needed, you can configure the arguments to pass when opening repos or files in your selected editor.\n\nImprovements üôå\n- Worktrees:\n  - The Commit Graph now displays a worktree icon when the branch is associated with a linked worktree.\n  - Worktrees in the left panel will show WIP summary and ahead/behind status.\n  - Selecting a branch in the breadcrumb that is checked out in a worktree will now open that worktree.\n  - Added a context menu option to Pull Requests in the Left Panel to check out the Pull Request in a new worktree.\n  - When a worktree is opened in a repository tab, the tab icon will change to a worktree icon.\n- You can now edit custom Launchpad views.\n- Added an option to relocate a workspace repo in your filesystem if the repo was not found.\n- Added an option to locate workspace repo in filesystem if the repo has multiple possible paths.\n- When auto-fetch fails silently, a warning icon will show on the REMOTES left panel section header.\n- Updated Git to 2.47.0.\n- We periodically remove features with low usage in order to focus our maintenance efforts on areas that impact users the most.\n  - Removed the dedicated Terminal tab. (We found that users overwhelmingly prefer to use the terminal panel which is embedded in repository tabs.)\n  - Removed a rarely-used feature where the Commit Detail Panel could be pinned to the bottom of the screen.\n\nBug Fixes üêõ\n- Custom GitLab Self-Managed avatars should now load properly in Launchpad.\n- Opening a linked worktree in the file manager now opens to the correct working directory.\n- Submodules should now remain intact when switching between worktrees.\n- Fixed an error involving labels that could occur when loading GitLab Self-Managed items in Launchpad.\n- Fixed an issue on Windows where custom hooks path in git config was not respected in some cases.\n- Fixed an issue where the GPG program was not found.\n- Fixed an issue where stash messages would not save properly if the branch contained a period.\n- Fixed an issue where a deleted custom Launchpad view would not be removed if it was deleted outside the client or in another client.\n- Fixed an issue creating Launchpad custom views with a sprint filter.\n- Fixed an issue when creating a Cloud Patch in Launchpad when the repo was in review mode.\n- Fixed an issue cloning Bitbucket Server Workspace repos when SSH is disabled for the Bitbucket Server instance.\n- Fixed an issue where both pull requests and issues would be loaded for custom Launchpad views.\n- Fixed an issue where Launchpad issues would not load when opening the client on a custom view.\n- Fixed an issue where Launchpad would not load if quickly switching views on app startup.\n- Fixed an issue with copying and pasting text within the diff view when switching back and forth between the different view modes (Hunk/Inline/Split).\n- Fixed an issue where hooks where not being executed from worktrees.\n- Fixed an issue where URLs and paths in WSL may not open in Windows correctly.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"10.6.0","site":"https://www.axosoft.com/","source":"GitKraken","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
