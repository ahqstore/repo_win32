It helps with eye strain, Dyslexia, Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome, or Visual Stress. You can easily turn the filter on and off, and customize the filter color and opacity. Try any color or tint to see which one works best for you (for example choose Orange that is known to block out the blue light responsible for sleep deprivation). Easy to use and portable.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.0.0","site":"https://www.east-tec.com/","source":"East-Tec","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
