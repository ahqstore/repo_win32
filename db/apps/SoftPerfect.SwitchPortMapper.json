For every connected port, the port mapper lists the MAC address, IP address and host names of the computers associated with that port.\nAdditionally, the software can display each clientâ€™s network card vendor, port speed, device type, VLAN assignments and statistics for every port. This can be of good assistance when troubleshooting network connectivity issues.\nKey features\n- Discovers managed switches by scanning your network.\n- Shows what is connected to every switch port in a simple table format.\n- Pulls ARP table from a router to display IP information of connected clients.\n- Scans the current subnet for MAC-to-IP address mappings if there is no router.\n- Comes in two editions: a GUI application and a console application for using in scripts.\n- Fully supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, including bulk operations.\n- Improved: Device type detection now includes colour-coded categories.\n- Improved: Better compatibility with certain SNMPv2/v3 implementations.\n- Fixed: Issue retrieving VLAN membership from dot1qVlanStaticEntry.\n- Changed: Versioning scheme updated to use the YY.MM format.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"25.6","version":0,"site":"https://www.softperfect.com/","source":"SoftPerfect Pty Ltd","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
