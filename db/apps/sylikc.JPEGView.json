Basic on-the-fly image processing is provided.\n\nJPEGView is a lean, fast and highly configurable image viewer/editor with a minimal GUI.\n\nFormats Supported\nJPEGView has built-in support the following formats:\n- Popular: JPEG, GIF\n- Lossless: BMP, PNG, TIFF, PSD\n- Web: WEBP, JXL, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF\n- Legacy: TGA, WDP, HDP, JXR\n- Camera RAW formats:\n  - Adobe (DNG), Canon (CRW, CR2, CR3), Nikon (NEF, NRW), Sony (ARW, SR2)\n  - Olympus (ORF), Panasonic (RW2), Fujifilm (RAF)\n  - Sigma (X3F), Pentax (PEF), Minolta (MRW), Kodak (KDC, DCR)\n  - A full list is available here: LibRaw supported cameras\nMany additional formats are supported by Windows Imaging Component (WIC)\n\nBasic Image Editor\nBasic on-the-fly image processing is provided - allowing adjusting typical parameters:\n- sharpness\n- color balance\n- rotation\n- perspective\n- contrast\n- local under-exposure/over-exposure\n\nOther Features\n- Small and fast, uses AVX2/SSE2 and up to 4 CPU cores\n- High quality resampling filter, preserving sharpness of images\n- Basic image processing tools can be applied realtime during viewing\n- Movie/Slideshow mode - to play folder of JPEGs as movie\nI wanted to make a special thanks to qbnu for coding the new formats support, along with optimizations and improvements to existing formats!\n(Minor version incremented to reflect the many changes between this and the previous release. It's tempting to keep \"waiting for the next feature to be done\" before releasing...)\nNew features:\n- Add support for modern RAW image formats with LibRaw, ex: CR3 (ICC profiles are supported)\n  PR #211, thanks qbnu\n- Add basic support for PSD (Adobe Photoshop Document)\n  - Color modes supported: Grayscale, RGB, CMYK, Multichannel, Duotone, Lab\n  - 8-bit depth PSDs only\n  - Compression modes supported: Raw/Uncompressed, RLE\n    (See PR for detailed supported/unsupported breakdown)\n    PR #233, thanks qbnu\n- Add support for reading EXIF data from JXL, HEIF, AVIF, WebP and PNG files\n  PR #213, thanks qbnu\n- Misc EXIF Metadata fixes:\n  - GPS info parsed from RAW metadata\n  - GPS coordinates in degrees+decimal minutes will now be converted to degrees+minutes+seconds\n  - Altitudes below sea level will now show negative\n  - Metadata will be shown for either RAW or JPEG, with RAW taking precedence\n    PR #211, thanks qbnu\n- RAW metadata's acquisition date shown in window title\n  PR #242, thanks qbnu\n- Add multithreading when decoding with libavif and reduced memory usage\n  Up to ~20% decoding speed improvement\n  PR #204, thanks qbnu\n- Optimize JXL and HEIF RGBA -> BGRA conversion\n  Speed up ~25% for JXL and ~150% for HEIF\n  PR #234, thanks qbnu\n- New INI file setting: WindowBorderlessOnStartup\n  On startup, set JPEGView window to borderless mode (title bar hidden)\n- New INI file setting: WindowAlwaysOnTopOnStartup\n  On startup, set JPEGView window to be always on top\nBugs fixed:\n- Adjust animation frame times to appear closer to their actual values\n  Accounts for time spent processing frame. (Minimum frame time is 10ms due to technical limitations)\n  PR #205, thanks qbnu\n  Changed behavior:\n- INI Option: UseEmbeddedColorProfiles=true can be used without losing Animated PNG support\n  ICC profiles are not supported for Animated PNG\n  PR #202, thanks qbnu\n- Renamed INI Option: OverrideOriginalFileWithoutSaveDialog -> OverwriteOriginalFileWithoutSaveDialog\n- Renamed INI Option: TrimWithoutPromptLosslessJPEG -> CropWithoutPromptLosslessJPEG\nOther changes:\n- Updated to library versions:\n  - libavif 1.0.1\n  - libde265 1.0.12\n  - libjxl 5d20fbe\n  - libpng 1.6.40\n  - libwebp 1.3.2 (Fixes CVE-2023-4863)\n  - zlib 1.3\n    PR #235, thanks qbnu\n- Official scoop.sh support in bucket extras/jpegview-fork\n  PR #223, thanks Tim Martin\nLocalization updates:\n- New language: sl Slovenian, thanks Jadran Rudec\n- New language: tr Turkish, thanks Kaya Zeren\n- New language: bg Bulgarian, thanks Ivan Georgiev\n- New translation: sr Serbian, thanks Ljuba Cirovic\n- New translation: hu Hungarian, thanks József Ujvári\n- New translation: fi Finnish, thanks Kari Eveli\n- New translation: sk Slovak, thanks Marián Hikaník\n- New translation: ta Tamil, thanks Nirmal G.\n- Updated Japanese translation, thanks maboroshin\n- Updated Korean translation, thanks VenusGirl\n- Updated Russian translation, thanks Dmitry Yerokhin\n- Updated Chinese (Taiwan) translation, by converting chs -> cht\n- Updated French translation, thanks Ronan Plantec\n- Updated Greek translation, thanks Michalis\n- Updated Polish translation, thanks Marcin Czerwien\n- Rename INI option: bel -> be (official ISO 639-1 naming)\n- Rename language: Belorussian to Belarusian (official naming)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.3.46.0","site":"https://github.com/sylikc/","source":"Kevin M (sylikc)","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
