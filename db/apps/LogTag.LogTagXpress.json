With a stripped-down feature set, LogTag Xpress focuses on efficiently configuring and downloading the complete range of LogTag data logging products, with as little user interaction as possible. You can use this program to quickly and efficiently arrange data to be downloaded, assessed and transferred to other information stakeholders, and to automatically re-configure the logger with little or no user input. LogTag Xpress is ideally suited to applications such as shipment data monitoring which may require quick data upload to LogTag Online without creating an account. Automatically download, upload and reconfigure LogTag loggers. Automatically upload to LogTag Online (LTO), via FTP or email files upon download. Export from multiple customizable file types including LTD, PDF and CSV.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.2.6.2","version":0,"site":"https://logtagrecorders.com/","source":"LogTag Recorders","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
