There is no need to worry about your QSOs during the uninstall, as the uninstall procedure does not delete the internal data of QLog. Of course, a backup is always recommended.\nIf you have installed versions 0.36 or newer, then it is not necessary to perform an uninstall.\nLINUX USERS\nThere is a known issue where QLog does not correctly restore the Layout. The bug is in the QT library and in QLog it is solved by a workaround, which does not always work. If the layout does not restore correctly, try clicking on the Activity again.\nFlatpak:\nQt 6.8.2\nhamlib 4.6.2\nWindows Libraries:\nQt 6.8.2 (Updated)\nopenssl 3.3.2\nhamlib 4.6.2 (Updated)\nTimezone DB: 2024b (https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases)\nBinaries:\nWindows: below\nFedora 40: below\nFedora 41: below\nUbuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04, 24.10: via PPA\nFlatpak package is available via Flathub.
