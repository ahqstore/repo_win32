Run tests in parallel; deploy faster.\n\n\n- ReadyAPI Compatibility: TestEngine 1.35.0 now fully supports ReadyAPI 3.65.0, ensuring seamless integration with the latest version.\n- Java 21 LTS Support: TestEngine now supports Java 21 LTS.\n- SLM Licensing and Data-Driven Tests (TSERV-2261 and TSERV-2288): Fixed an issue introduced in version 1.34.0 that prevented SLM licenses from running data-driven tests after the removal of file-based licensing. Data-driven tests now execute as expected with SLM licenses.\n- Database Growth and Runtime Exceptions (TSERV-2213): Fixed a memory leak that caused the testengine.mv.db file to grow excessively and trigger runtime exceptions. Updated the H2 configuration to improve memory management and prevent uncontrolled database growth.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.35.0","version":0,"site":"https://smartbear.com/","source":"SmartBear Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
