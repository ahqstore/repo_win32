It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* fix #780: Avoid module loading path check error on windows if path includes a\n  parenthesis\n* fix #789: Avoid warning on commandline about possible confusion when reading quoted\n  configuration value including a dash from configuration file\n* fix #790: Fix server URL parsing when it doesn't include scheme\n* Add glpi-version configuration support to handle inventory_format dependent features\n* Handle /now request as an event.
