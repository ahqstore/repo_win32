It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* Prevent certificates overwriting during export from Windows Keystore\n* Add new option to specify or disable Windows KeyStore support\n\ninventory:\n* fix #700: Add TacticalRMM Remote_Mgmt support for MacOSX\n* fix #711: Update Bitdefender AV support on Windows, and also update enable support\n  on Windows Server OS.\n* fix #716: Don't fail on regexp error while running from a user folder which contains\n  a parenthesis\n* fix #748: Don't include lastloggeduser in hardware section in partial inventory\n  if users section is being deleted after no change detected\n* Updated pci.ids to 2024.09.20 version\n* Bump Inventory task version to 1.18\n\nnetdiscovery/netinventory:\n* Skip Konica printers firmware with \"Registered\" set as version\n* Enhanced Hikvision devices support\n* Updated sysobject.ids\n* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 6.4\n* Bump NetInventory task version to 6.4\n\ndeploy:\n* Avoid perl syntax error when running Powershell script from Deploy task on windows\n* Bump Deploy task version to 3.3\n\nproxy-server-plugin:\n* Always evaluate only_local_store to yes when glpi_protocol is set and no server is\n  configured so default required format remains json\n* Bump Proxy plugin version to 2.5\n\npackaging:\n* Update Windows MSI packing building process to use:\n  - OpenSSL 3.3.2\n  - libxml2 2.13.4\n* Update MacOSX packages to use OpenSSL 3.3.2\n* Windows MSI installer now supports AGENTMONITOR_NEWTICKET_SCREENSHOT as option to\n  configure if GLPI-AgentMonitor should always create a screenshot on new ticket.\n  The default set value is 1 and means to always create a screenshot.\n* Updated Windows packages 7-Zip commandline tools to v24.08\n* win32: Updated GLPI-AgentMonitor to v1.4.0","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.11","site":"https://glpi-project.org/","source":"Teclib'","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
