These releases include everything in the previous 2601.15 release, plus:\n- 2602.25: includes support for all of the new D3D12 features released today in Agility SDK 619.0, including Shader Model 6.9, DXR 1.2 (OMMs, SER), revised view creation, and more.\n- 2602.25-preview: includes everything in 2602.25, plus support for new D3D12 preview features in Agility SDK 719.0 such as fence barriers and extensions.\nBy default we recommend that all PIX users use non-preview versions of PIX (e.g. 2502.25). We only recommend that you use preview versions of PIX (e.g. 2602.25-preview) if you are trying out new preview D3D12 features.\nBoth versions of PIX include correctness fixes and quality-of-life improvements listed below. As usual, please get in touch with us if you have any feedback or hit any issues!
