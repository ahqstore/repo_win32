Markdown can be used to document your FreeFEM scripts (see for example the .md files in the examples/examples directory). When running a .md file, FreeFEM will execute the code contained in the FreeFEM code blocks, delimited by\n  ```freefem\n  [freefem code]\n  ```\n  Documented Markdown examples in the distribution can be viewed on the documentation website (toggle Search in examples). Markdown can be previewed with e.g Visual Studio Code, with the FreeFEM VS Code extension providing syntax highlighting for FreeFEM code blocks.\n- add command md2edp to extract freefem code form Markdown file.\n- PETSc 3.22.2\n- move the plugin msh3 in kernel , so remove all load \"msh3\" in all examples and .idp files\nSee CHANGELOG 4.15 for more detail\nRemark,a small error has slipped into the version number in version 4.15 : the name of the version is 4.14 ( ... git v 4.15...) on apple silicon and intel mac version., not 4.15 ( ... git v 4.15...) , sorry, I will correct soon.\nThe new Mac version (develop) works after security authorization (see README.md)\n(see the short movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEF4PAkR51g to understand howto do )\nif you do not succed please\nsend me a Mail to: frederic.hecht@sorbonne-universite.fr.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.15","version":0,"site":"https://freefem.org/","source":"Frédéric Hecht","license_or_tos":"GNU General Public Licence v3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
