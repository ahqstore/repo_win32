All of your downloads are kept in a single place and are automatically updated. Access your collections and purchases, or browse for new games via the in-app browser.\nPlease Note: This will be the last version of the app compatible with Windows 7 and 8.\nThis release upgrades a number of dependencies, especially Electron (to version 22), to resolve some lingering security issues. It also includes some performance and efficiency improvements.\nThe logic for game updates has changed. The app will check for updates any time you view a game page or run a game. You can check your full library for game updates at any time in the Preferences menu via the \"Check for game updates\" action.\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/itchio/itch/compare/v25.6.2...v26.1.9","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"26.1.9","site":"https://itch.io/","source":"itch corp.","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
