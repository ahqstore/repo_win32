Analysis can be performed in both real time or after recording and includes a Classifier feature for detection and exclusion of atypical waveforms.\nChanges Since Previous Version\nThere have been various enhancements and changes to the following:\n- The Blood Pressure Table View now has a help button\n- With very large numbers of events (more than about 16000), adding the Table View contents to the Data Pad now copies the whole of the Table View contents and summary information, not just the first 16000 rows. The amount of data that can be added is limited by the amount of available memory on the PC\n- Improvements have been made to memory handling.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.4.0400","version":0,"site":null,"source":"ADInstruments","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
