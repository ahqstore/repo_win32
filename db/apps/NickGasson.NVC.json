This behaviour is not defined by the LRM but matches all other simulators (#1144).\n- MSYS2 binary packages are no longer provided with releases as these become out-of-date too quickly. Windows users should instead download the self-contained MSI package.\n- The Ubuntu binary packages for releases now have predictable names without the git commit hash (#1131).\n- Improved error messages when design units have circular dependencies or depend on obsolete design units (#1152).\n- Toggle coverage count is displayed correctly for unreachable constant driven toggle bins and transitions from X are counted with --count-from-undefined instead of just U.\n- Added an experimental --preserve-case analysis option to retain the original spelling of VHDL identifiers (#723).\n-  --ieee-warnings is now a global option and should be placed before the -r command. Passing it to the -r command is still supported but deprecated and may not take effect in some situations (#1151).\n- Fixed a crash when a partial association in a port map has a conversion function (#1161).\n- Improved the formatting of the --help output.\n- The GitHub Action has been renamed from nickg/setup-nvc-ci to nickg/setup-nvc, although the old name should redirect to the new.\n- A Docker image was added at ghcr.io/nickg/nvc (#1165).\n- Unconstrained input ports can now be constrained by the result subtype of a conversion function (#1171).\n- Type marks are now allowed in the prefix of selected names in relaxed mode (#1173).\n- Added the nvc.random random number generation package and --seed argument for deterministic results.\n- Added support for PSL union operator (from @Blebowski).\n- The implementation of concatenations has been reworked fixing several bugs (#1178).\n- Added support for conditional force assignment (#1185).\n- Access and file types are now supported in VHPI (#1192).\n- Fixed a crash when open actual was used for formal parameter without default.\n- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1174, #1159, #1177, #1191, #1188).\nSpecial thank you to @bpadalino, @tmeissner, @Blebowski, @amb5l, @m42uko, @a-panella, @cmarqu, @albydnc, @johonkanen, and @augustofg for sponsoring me!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.16.0","site":null,"source":"Nick Gasson","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
