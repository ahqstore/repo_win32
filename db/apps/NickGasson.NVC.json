The related --with-system-cc configure option has also been removed.\n- The --stderr=none option now prevents any diagnostic messages being printed to stderr, including those at failure severity (#1357).\n- The VITAL and Synopsys packages are now compiled into the ieee library for VHDL-2019 (#1360).\n- The new --relative=DIR analysis option saves all file names relative to DIR. This can be useful to ensure reproducibility of binary libraries (#1359).\n- Very large subprograms containing tens of thousands of operations can now be compiled (#1259).\n- Added -Werror analysis option to escalate warnings into errors.\n- Code coverage report style was improved and average coverage numbers are now printed after a run completes.\n- Expression coverage reporting for multi-line expressions was improved.\n- Fixed waveform dumping for arrays of enumerated types (#1362).\n- The fractional part of std.env.epoch is now correct and to_string on std.env.time_record now displays months correctly according to ISO 8601 (#1381).\n- Verilog support has improved significantly, with the ZipCPU FFT core now able to be simulated (#1336).\n- Elaboration of large netlists is now significantly faster (#1331, #1341).\n- Updated to OSVVM 2025.06a and UVVM 2025.11.28 for nvc --install.\n- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1237, #1350, #1351, #1353, #1366, #1372, #1333, #1388, #1393, #1396, #1395).\nSpecial thank you to @bpadalino, @tmeissner, @Blebowski, @amb5l, @m42uko, @a-panella, @cmarqu, @albydnc, @johonkanen, and @augustofg for sponsoring me!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.19.0","version":0,"site":null,"source":"Nick Gasson","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
