It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing.\n🗣 Join our community:\nF3D Community is welcoming to users and developers alike!\nAsk questions, gets involved and starts contributing in a beginner-friendly environment.\n❤️ Sponsor F3D:\nF3D is open source and needs your support!\nMany thanks to all our one time sponsors!\nMuch love to our monthly sponsors for this release ❤️\nNGIZeroCore | LambdaTest-Inc | OpenDroneMap\n@jgod @exbluesbreaker @parkerlreed @Saijin-Naib @CriticalPoint\n⚗️ New Alembic Features!\nF3D is now able to read Xform animations and Curves from the alembic format!\nImage\n🇨 C bindings\nThe libf3d now have C bindings for complete intercompatibility\nwith other languages:\nhttps://f3d.app/docs/next/libf3d/LANGUAGE_BINDINGS#c\nHere is a quick prototype of Julia binding that uses the libf3d C bindings:\nhttps://github.com/joa-quim/F3D.jl\n🔃 Complete examples\nWe now have libf3d examples for:\n- C bindings\n- Python bindings\n- Java bindings\n- C++ bindings with multiple usecase\n- FLTK\n- Qt6\n- QML\nSee how easy it is to create your own app using the libf3d!\n  // Load static/native plugins\n  f3d::engine::autoloadPlugins();\n  // Create a native-window engine\n  f3d::engine eng = f3d::engine::create();\n  // Modify options using the struct API\n  f3d::options& opt = eng.getOptions();\n  opt.render.grid.enable = true;\n  opt.render.show_edges = true;\n  // UI overlays: axis + some HUD\n  opt.ui.axis = true;\n  opt.ui.fps = true;\n  opt.ui.animation_progress = true;\n  opt.ui.filename
