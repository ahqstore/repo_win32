It supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets (including glTF, USD, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, Alembic), can show animations and support thumbnails and many rendering and texturing options including real time physically based rendering and raytracing.\nmain\nüó£ Join our community:\nF3D Community is welcoming to users and developers alike!\nAsk questions, gets

sponsors for this release ‚ù§Ô∏è\n@jgod @exbluesbreaker @parkerlreed @Saijin-Naib @CriticalPoint @Ramalama2\nüñºÔ∏è Gaussian Splatting improvements\nWe have improved gaussian splatting support in F3D!\nYou can now open .spz and .ply files along with the existing .splat support.\nMoreover, these new formats support spherical harmonics for high quality renders.\nsplat\nüî¨ New scivis formats\nScivis rendering has always been a big part of F3D userbase and we want to make sure we keep improving on that regard!\nYou can now open VTKHDF (.vtkhdf) and NetCDF (.nc) in F3D.\nAlso you can now open .usd file with embedded EXR textures.\nblob\nüï∂Ô∏è New UI style\nIn F3D 3.0 we have introduced a new UI based on ImGui, we now have styled it using the new color palette of F3D!\nui\nüìù Complete changelog\nFor F3D users:\n- Added support for VTKHDF format, including AMR datasets (Thanks @Lgt2x !)\n- Added support for SPZ and PLY gaussian splatting format\n- Added a
