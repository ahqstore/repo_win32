From small rooftop systems with to medium-sized systems on commercial roofs to solar parks - PV*SOL premium supports you with numerous tools for design and simulation.\nThe unique 3D visualization is the highlight of PV*SOL premium. You can visualize all common types of systems in 3D, whether roof-integrated or roof-mounted, whether on small angled roofs, large industrial halls or open spaces - with up to 7,500 mounted modules or up to 10,000 roof-parallel modules - and calculate the shading based on 3D objects. With the realistic shading from surrounding objects, you can achieve the highest reliability for your yield forecast.\nAll other design types from PV*SOL are of course also available in PV*SOL premium. Whether calculating self-consumption, designing battery storage or integrating electric vehicles - with PV*SOL premium you can implement all customer wishes in no time at all.\nOur extensive product database includes over 26,000 PV modules, 7,500 inverters, 5,500 battery systems and many other products such as electric vehicles and performance optimizers. It is updated regularly by the product manufacturers themselves, so you can always work with the latest data.\nYou can generate high-quality project reports for your customers that can be edited as required. Circuit diagrams with the necessary safety devices can also be created, e.g. for submission to the relevant authorities.\nThe current feed-in tariffs are available in our database for the calculation of economic efficiency. By adding the information to the system costs, you will receive a detailed economic analysis of the system over 20 years. This allows you to create an initial offer in just a few minutes.\nPV*SOL premium is available in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and Turkish ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·. And with project reports available in 23 languages, language barriers are a thing of the past.\nOur technical support team and our help pages offer you assistance with your questions. In our forum you can address more complex questions to our team and other PV*SOL premium users.\nThe following new features and changes are included:\n- Revised calculation of direct own use of PV energy for DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery systems with time-controlled charging from the grid.\n- When planning with a DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery system with time-controlled charging and the energy at the inverter input is less than the charge of the DC storage, the Sankey diagram is no longer displayed in the results. This can occur if the DC storage is also charged from the grid.\nThe following bugs have been fixed:\n- Crash when opening the Results page if a project from the previous version is loaded in which the simulation results were saved.\n- Error in the display of data series from thermal systems when exporting to a *.csv file.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2025.10","site":"https://valentin-software.com/en/","source":"Valentin Software GmbH","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
