As with any tool of this kind, we recommend creating a new system restore point before using it, so that you can revert your system at any time if you run into problems.\n- Added a link to the official DDU Merchandise Shop to help support development.\n- Updated several translations.\n- General fixes and improvements.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"18.1.3.9","version":0,"site":"https://www.wagnardsoft.com/","source":"Wagnardsoft","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
