As with any tool of this kind, we recommend creating a new system restore point before using it, so that you can revert your system at any time if you run into problems.\n- Fixed a potential infinite loop issue that could cause the cleanup process to hang in some cases.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"18.1.3.7","version":0,"site":"https://www.wagnardsoft.com/","source":"Wagnardsoft","license_or_tos":"Freeware","resources":null,"verified":false}
