By configuring renaming methods the names can be manipulated in various ways.\nIt is easy to set up a batch rename using multiple methods on a large amount of files. The 13 different methods enables you to change the names, and timestamps of files in one go. The files can also be copied or moved to new locations based on information in the files.\nWith Advanced Renamer you can construct new file names by adding, removing, replacing, changing case, or giving the file a brand new name based on known information about the file.\nBefore performing the operations on the files you can verify that the output will be correct and if you perform the rename and regret it, you can undo the complete batch.\nChanges to metadata writer\n\nThe user interface for the metadata batch writer has changed to better support large batches. The user interface is not more compact and performs better when many files are shown in the list.\n\nYou can now also use tags when setting metadata values. This makes it possible to set metadata values based on other metadata values or file properties.\n\nName collision rule improvements\n\nA new Name Collision rule has been added called Append Character. It works in the same way as Append Number, but instead of appending a number to make the filename unique, it will append characters (A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, etc), like the <Inc Alpha> tag.\n\nThe Append Number rule now has a new option to start from a custom number instead of 1. To force a specific number length, append zeros, like this to get a 4 digit number: 0001.\n\nFull list of changes in version 4.19\n- Item Details Panel: Will show a message if metadata analysis is turned off in settings\n- Folder Panel: Show selected folder in edit box\n- Replace Method: Fixed named groups when using regular expressions\n- List Replace Method: Button, Move To Bottom, when shown in a separate window did not work\n- Command Palette: Recent method presets now available through command palette\n- Command Palette: Will remember the last 5 used commands between program restarts\n- MacOS: Program settings has moved to a different folder, to be more compliant with Mac conventions.
