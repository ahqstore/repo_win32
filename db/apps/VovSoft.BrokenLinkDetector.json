On the other hand, if you are an advanced user, you may want to take a glimpse of the extra options so that you can manage connection timeout, response timeout, user-agent, ignored extensions, and ignored URLs.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.3.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
