NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.\nSecure. NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.\nWhat's Changed\n- Bump golang.org/x/net from 0.30.0 to 0.33.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3218\n- [client, server] Cleanup magiconair usage from repo by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3276\n- Management REST Client Code by @mohamed-essam in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3278\n- [client] use embedded root CA if system certpool is empty by @hakansa in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3272\n- [misc] Replace Wiretrustee with Netbird by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3267\n- [client] Fix acl empty port range detection by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3285\n- [relay] Use new upstream for nhooyr.io/websocket package by @paralin in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3287\n- [client] Fix grouping of peer ACLs with different port ranges by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3289\n- [client] Fix nil pointer exception when load empty list and try to cast it by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3282\n- [management] Check groups when counting peers on networks list by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3284\n- [management] add logs for grpc API by @pascal-fischer in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3298\n- [client] Add experimental support for userspace routing by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3134\n- [signal] Fix context propagation in signal server by @4thel00z in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3251\n- [client, relay] Fix/wg watch by @pappz in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3261\n- [client] Support dns upstream failover for nameserver groups with same match domain by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3178\n- [client] Fix dns handler chain test by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3307\n- [client] Check for fwmark support and use fallback routing if not supported by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3220\n- [client] Enable userspace forwarder conditionally by @lixmal in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3309\n- fix integration tests by @pnmcosta in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3311\nNew Contributors\n- @hakansa made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3272\n- @paralin made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3287\n- @4thel00z made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3251\n- @pnmcosta made their first contribution in https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/3311\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/compare/v0.36.5...v0.36.6","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"0.36.6","site":"https://netbird.io/","source":"Wiretrustee UG (haftungsbeschreankt)","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
