The Java environment is based on the open source project OpenJDK which does not cause any Oracle dependencies. The browser allows the use of and for Abacus generated certificates without warning messages.\nAbaClient recognises and supports the new \"abalink\" format, which will be used from Abacus version 2019.\nAbaClient also serves as a replacement for the product AbaStart.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"3.3.1039","site":"https://www.abacus.ch/en/","source":"Abacus Research AG","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
