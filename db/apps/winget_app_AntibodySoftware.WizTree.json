Note that these hidden drives can still be selected by using 'Select Folder' and then typing in the drive name, e.g. \"c:\" (like Windows Explorer allows)\n- percentage displayed for file extensions was not calculated correctly when multiple items were scanned together - fixed\n- Percentages displayed will now always default to being calculated using \"allocated\" values instead of \"size\", unless sort order is set to \"Size\" as \"Allocated\" is the default sort order\n- Duplicate detection method now defaults to name, size AND date (previously just name and size) - will affect new installs only\n- it's now possible to set the WizTree config folder location via command line parameter. e.g. /configfolder=\"c:\\WizTreeConfig\"\n  OR by creating the following registry key:\n  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Antibody Software\\WizTree\n  and creating a string named \"configfolder\" within this key containing the config file folder location.\n  The command line parameter will take precedence over the registry key. This setting and command line work with both the installer (setup) and WizTree executables (4.24 or newer)","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.24","site":"https://antibody-software.com/","source":"Antibody Software","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
