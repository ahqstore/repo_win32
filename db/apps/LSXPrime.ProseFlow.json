With a simple hotkey, you can access a menu of customizable AI actions to proofread, summarize, refactor, or transform text in any application—be it your code editor, browser, or word processor.\n﻿# 🎉 ProseFlow v0.3.0 – Release Notes\nWe are excited to launch ProseFlow v0.3.0, a landmark release that transforms how you create and use AI-powered actions. This update introduces Templated Actions with Placeholders, a powerful new Generation Mode for creating content from scratch, and a completely overhauled Actions UI with bulk-management capabilities.\nThese features turn simple prompts into dynamic, reusable, and shareable tools, elevating ProseFlow from a text processor to a comprehensive AI workflow engine.\n\n🌟 Highlights\n1. Templated Actions with Placeholders\nActions are no longer static prompts! You can now create dynamic, multi-step workflows by embedding placeholders (e.g., [language]) in your instructions. When you run a templated action, the floating menu guides you through a step-by-step form to fill in the details.\n- Multiple Input Types: Choose from Text, Multiline Text, Choice (dropdown), Boolean (Yes/No), Number, Date, and even a File Picker.\n- Validation Rules: Enforce required fields, set character limits, or define numeric ranges to ensure valid input.\n- Conditional Logic: Create intelligent workflows by showing or hiding subsequent steps based on user input.\n- Smart Defaults: Pre-fill values with dynamic tokens like {clipboard}, {date:yyyy-MM-dd}, and {appContext} to accelerate common tasks.\n- New Presets: Get started with powerful new templated actions, including Summarize, Translate, Rephrase, Write an Email, and Create Social Media Post.\n💡 This feature transforms simple actions into sophisticated, reusable applications for complex tasks.\nAdvanced Action Editor Templated Action Menu\n\n2. Generation Mode & Enhanced Custom Instructions\nProseFlow now excels at creating content from scratch. Actions can be designated as not requiring selected text (requiresSelection: false), enabling a new Generation Mode.\n- Generate from Scratch: When no text is selected, the floating menu filters for generation-capable actions. The search bar becomes a prompt input field, allowing you to describe what you want to create.\n- Save Custom Instructions: The \"Custom Instruction\" feature now logs the full instruction to your history. You can save these ad-hoc prompts as new, reusable actions directly from the history view with a single click.\n\n3. Overhauled Actions UI with Bulk Management\nThe Actions screen has been completely redesigned for power users and teams managing large sets of actions.\n- Multi-Selection: Use checkboxes to select multiple actions at once.\n- Contextual Toolbar: A new toolbar appears when items are selected, enabling bulk operations:\n  - Bulk Delete: Permanently remove multiple actions.\n  - Bulk Move: Move selected actions to another group in one step.\n  - Bulk Export: Export only the selected actions to a JSON file.\n- Action Management: Actions can now be easily duplicated or moved up/down within their group from a new context menu.\n\n🛠️ Core & Infrastructure Improvements\n📄 New Document Reader Service\nA powerful new IDocumentReaderService can now extract plain text from various file types, enabling the new \"File Picker\" placeholder. Supported formats include:\n- .pdf\n- .docx\n- .xlsx, .xls\n- .epub\n- .txt, .md, and many other plain-text-like formats.\n🚀 Refactored Startup Logic\nThe application's startup process has been decomposed into modular, single-responsibility services (DatabaseInitializer, BackgroundServiceInitializer, UiInitializer, DependencyInjectionSetup, etc.).\n- Improved Maintainability: Cleaner, more organized code makes future development easier.\n- Resilient Database Handling: A new recovery flow gracefully handles database corruption by prompting the user to back up the corrupt file and reset the application data, preventing startup failures.\n\n🎨 UI & UX Refinements\n✍️ Redesigned Action Editor\nThe Action Editor has been rebuilt from the ground up to support templated actions:\n- An intuitive interface for adding, configuring, and removing placeholders.\n- Dedicated sections for setting up validation rules and conditional display logic.\n- A smart token inserter for easily adding dynamic default values.\n🎓 Enhanced Onboarding\n- A new tutorial step introduces users to the power of templated actions with an interactive simulation.\n- A visual progress indicator now tracks your journey through the setup process.\n- The hotkey tutorial has been updated to better reflect the Diff View output mode.\n\n❤️ Thank You\nThis release is a huge step forward for ProseFlow, making it a more versatile and powerful tool for everyone.\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.\n— LSXPrime","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.3.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/LSXPrime","source":"ProseFlow","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
