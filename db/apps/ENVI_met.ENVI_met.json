This enables focused environmental analyses without running a full holistic model, significantly reducing simulation time when only specific factors are needed","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"5.8.0","version":0,"site":"https://envi-met.com/","source":"ENVI-met GmbH Essen, Germany","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
