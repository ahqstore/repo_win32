This assumption is made to easily retain backwards compatibility with the old file storage schema.\nFor custom launchers/wrappers\nIf \"cloudflare\" is contained in the download server name, then the file URL should be constructed as such:\n{download_server_url_base}/{platform_str}/{game_file_posix_path}.gz\nAny other download server (AWS is the only other current download server) may continue to use the existing scheme.\nTweaks\n- Breaking: Switch to using uncompressed file hash from manifest for validation instead of compressed file hash\n- Make corrupted config file messages more informative","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.4.0","site":"https://github.com/CorporateClash","source":"Corporate Clash","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
