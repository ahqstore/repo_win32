It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* Fix glpi-agent script listed supported categories\n* Update deviceid on startup if assetname-support or even hostname changes\n\ninventory:\n* fix #917: Fix CrowdStrike Falcon antivirus support on linux\n* Fix TeamViewer ID remote management inventory on linux\n* PR #920: Added Astra Linux distro support in distro inventory\n* PR #944: Fix MSSQL database inventory\n* fix #947: Always support inventory task event for server target if not partial\n* fix #919: Don't inventory Hyper-V virtualmachine as WSL\n* fix #948: Fix fqdn on linux for assetname-support=3\n* Updated pci.ids to 2025.06.09 version\n* Bump Inventory task version to 1.22\n\nremoteinventory:\n* First try hostname command to find system fqdn and domain via ssh\n* Bump RemoteInventory task version to 1.8\n\nnetdiscovery/netinventory:\n* fix #896: Don't override manufacturer for devices with wrong sysobjectid\n* fix #904: Fix page counters support for Xerox printers\n* fix #946: Add Digipower PDUs support\n* Updated sysobject.ids\n* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 6.8\n* Bump NetInventory task version to 6.8\n\nesx:\n* fix #941: Fix perl error on non existing perl ref\n* Bump ESX task version to 2.14\n\ninjector:\n* fix #921: Provide an agentid on json submission when sending content from stdin\n\ntoolbox:\n* fix #783: Fix \"No Valid Agentid set on HTTP Client\" error on remote inventory tasks\n* Fix scheduling not working when set on \"tuesday\"\n* Bump ToolBox plugin version to 1.6\n\npackaging:\n* Update Windows packaging to use:\n  - gcc 15.1.0posix-12.0.0-msvcrt-r1\n  - Perl patch to fix CVE-2025-40909\n  - OpenSSL 3.5.0\n  - libxml2 2.14.3\n  - removed not required locale support\n  - dmidecode 3.6-update-1\n  - MSI installer and windows binaries are now signed\n* Update MacOSX packages to use OpenSSL 3.5.0\n* win32: Updated GLPI-AgentMonitor to v1.4.1","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.15","version":0,"site":"https://glpi-project.org/","source":"Teclib'","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
