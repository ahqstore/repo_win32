It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* fix #851: glpi-agent should also try to request CONTACT after GLPI 10+ answer on PROLOG\n* Reworked target responses caching for event handling\n* Support 'none' as proxy configuration to not try to use proxy set in environment variables\n\ninventory:\n* On windows, don't cache system is not 64 bits for the service lifetime as this can\n  be the result of a failed WMI call at the service start.\n* Fix PostgreSQL inventory when password is given by dedicated databaseinventory plugin\n* Add \"required-category\" configuration support to always include listed categories in\n  partial inventory generated while postponing full inventory. You can need to setup this\n  option if you're using GLPI rules based on possibly not changing inventory part. For\n  example, you can set it to \"network\" if you use rules to set asset location from asset\n  ip address or network.\n* Add \"itemtype\" configuration support to handle requirement for servers supporting genericity\n  like GLPI 11+.
