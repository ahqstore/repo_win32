It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* On windows, permit to use libxml2 built libraries in different threads\n* Reset target id after loading saved state to avoir re-using same id after a\n  target configuration update\n* PR #1051: Add support for ssk-key-file option helping to setup inventory\n  authentication via ssl client certificate.
