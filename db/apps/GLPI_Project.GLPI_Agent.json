It can perform a certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a GLPI server acting as a control point.\nThis agent is based on a fork of FusionInventory agent and so works mainly like FusionInventory agent. It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory feature. Anyway it also keeps the compatibility with FusionInventory for GLPI plugin.\ncore:\n* Refacto GLPI::Agent::Config to use generic defaults where necessary\n* Refacto SNMP support: Support of a new \"snmp-advanced-support.cfg\" configuration file\n  to tune snmp support and permit glpi-agent to handle some rare cases.\n* fix #880: Always requests PROLOG when tasks are forced on HTTPd UI before glpi-agent\n  know if server is a GLPI 10+ server\n\ninventory:\n* PR #876: Fix Microsoft Defender AV detection on Windows Server\n* PR #884: Updated UUID detection on Solaris Global Zones\n* Added support for CrowndStrike Falcon as antivirus on windows, macosx & linux\n* fix #894: Fix Windows Store inventory for packages referenced to be installed\n  on a no more available account\n* Fix PostgreSQL database inventory on windows\n* Updated usb.ids to 2025.04.01 version\n* Bump Inventory task version to 1.21\n\nnetdiscovery/netinventory:\n* fix #840: Add Snom phones support with \"snmp-advanced-support.cfg\" file specific configuration\n* Fix --entity option support in glpi-netinventory script\n* Enhanced EMC support for Dell EMC devices with experimental SNMP OIDs\n* fix #873: Enhanced support for Netgear stacked devices\n* fix #897: Support Katusha printers supporting Printer-MIB in LinuxAppliance\n* Added support for IP-MIB as fallback port ip discovery\n* fix #900: Support Quantum Linux Appliance\n* fix #818: Also detect HP printers on private OID\n* Enhanced HP storages and printers support\n* Updated sysobject.ids\n* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 6.7\n* Bump NetInventory task version to 6.7\n\ncollect:\n* Fix REG_MULTI_SZ registry value type support\n* Enhanced CSRF access denied support\n* Bump Collect task version to 2.11\n\npackaging:\n* Default etc/snmp-advanced-support.cfg now included in packages\n* On debian packaging, etc/toolbox-plugin.cfg is now included in glpi-agent-task-network\n* Update Windows packaging to use:\n  - Patched Perl 5.40.2 built using Perl::Dist::StrawBerry perl library processing\n  - libxml2 2.14.1\n  - msys2-base 20250221\n* Update MacOSX packages to use perl 5.40.2","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"1.14","site":"https://glpi-project.org/","source":"Teclib'","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
