Sometimes video quality is not the main factor, so why not go \"negative\" instead of \"positively\" doing an elaborate encoding? This software calls hardware-accelerated encoding (e.g. NVENC), which is a very effective method. Although it is often said that the quality of the generated video is not as good as x264, it is sufficient in most cases, isn't it?\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.0.8","site":"https://zyzsdy.com/","source":"Ted Zyzsdy","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
