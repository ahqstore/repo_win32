It supports all disc formats and all common file systems. Insert a disc, USB stick or memory card, Start up IsoBuster and select the drive or media (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the partitions or tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file system. Instead of being limited to one file system that the OS picks for you, you have access to \"the complete picture\". Access data from older sessions or hidden partitions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.\nIsoBuster 5.7 was released today. With preview of PDF, RTF, Txt and improved handling of home made Video discs, this version is yet another great update.
