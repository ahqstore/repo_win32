It supports all disc formats and all common file systems. Insert a disc, USB stick or memory card, Start up IsoBuster and select the drive or media (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the partitions or tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file system. Instead of being limited to one file system that the OS picks for you, you have access to \"the complete picture\". Access data from older sessions or hidden partitions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.\nWe released IsoBuster 5.6 today. The main effort went to preview functionality of a wide range of picture formats and video formats as well as digital audio-track playback and a different type of visualization of bad sectors on a disc. Read the the release notes for all the details.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"5.6","site":"https://www.isobuster.com/","source":"Smart Projects","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
