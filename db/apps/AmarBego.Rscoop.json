Rscoop isn't just a pretty face; it's a powerhouse of functionality designed to be a complete replacement for the command line. Its intuitive, modern UI is incredibly easy to grasp, making package management a breeze for both new and experienced users.\nRelease Notes 1.4.3\nAdded\n- Settings Page Redesign: Settings are now organized into clear tabs (Automation, Management, Security, Window & UI, About) for faster navigation.\n- Automatic Bucket & Package Updates: Background scheduler with wall-clock persistence auto-updates buckets and optionally packages after bucket refresh. Supports custom intervals and short debug intervals.\n- Start on Boot: New Startup toggle lets Rscoop launch automatically with Windows; integrates version-aware MSI mismatch handling.\n- Auto cleanup: Automatically clean up old versions and cache on install/update and uninstall\nImproved\n- Version-Aware Launch Behavior: Updated builds trigger a mismatch notice even on auto-start to ensure a clean post-update relaunch.\nDocumentation\n- Updated settings to reflect new changes\n1.4.4 specific ⇒\nBug Fixes / Reliability\n- Startup Event Race: Registered cold-start and readiness listeners before any asynchronous update/network checks to prevent missed backend events causing long (10s) spinner fallback.\n- Updater Timeout Stall: Moved update check to deferred phase after readiness with a 4s timeout safeguard so a slow/failed request no longer blocks initial UI rendering.\n- Duplicate Emissions Reduced: Added is_cold_start_ready backend command to allow future polling and reduce reliance on repeated multi-attempt event emission loops.\n- Loading Screen Variability: Eliminated cases where loading screen persisted until fallback due to late listener registration; readiness now reflects actual cold-start completion promptly.\n- Resilience on Network Errors: Gracefully logs updater failures without elevating severity or holding UI readiness state.\n- Debug logs: Now rotate upon launch to not cause exhaustive debugs","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.4.4","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/AmarBego","source":"rscoop","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
