Rscoop isn't just a pretty face; it's a powerhouse of functionality designed to be a complete replacement for the command line. Its intuitive, modern UI is incredibly easy to grasp, making package management a breeze for both new and experienced users.\nRelease Notes 1.4.5\nNew Features\n- Native MSI Launch Fix: Rscoop now automatically detects if it was launched in a restricted MSI context (common after fresh installs) and seamlessly relaunches itself with correct permissions and working directory. The \"MSI Launch Notice\" screen has been removed.\n- Enhanced Manifest Viewer: The manifest viewer now features improved syntax highlighting (Atom One Dark), a copy-to-clipboard button, and a cleaner UI.\nImprovements\n- Massive Backend Refactor:\n  - Non-blocking Operations: Heavy tasks like searching, status checks, and updates now run in non-blocking threads, keeping the UI responsive even during intensive operations.\n  - Modular Architecture: Scheduler logic moved to a dedicated module; cleaner separation of concerns across commands.\n  - Robust Junction Handling: The linker now uses multiple strategies (std fs, cmd, PowerShell) to reliably remove and create junctions, fixing issues with version switching.\n- State Management: Package info modals now automatically update their state after operations (install/uninstall/update) without needing to close and reopen.\n- Performance: Optimized file system scanning and modification time checks.\n- Packages without Buckets: Packages without buckets display normally and warn the User the bucket is missing\n- Moved View Manifest Button: Moved to the Modal itself for ease of access for power-users\n- Slight theming and consistency Improvements: To unify it better text and colors have been slightly adjusted\nBug Fixes\n- Versioned Installs: Fixed issues where install.json was missing or unreadable for versioned package installs.\n- Bucket Manifests: Improved logic for locating and counting manifests within buckets, supporting both flat and nested structures.\n- Auto-Cleanup: Ensure auto-cleanup is reliably triggered after uninstalling packages or clearing cache.\n- Search: Fixed JSON parsing for bin fields in manifests to correctly identify binary matches.\nNext Version\n- Light Mode: Next version will include a light theme\n- Accent Colors: Selectable accent colors\n- Got any ideas?: Open an issue!","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.4.5","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/AmarBego","source":"rscoop","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
