You can import your domain name list using clipboard, txt files, or drag-and-drop. Results can be exported as TXT or CSV files.\n\nWhether you're planning to buy or sell a domain name, or just want to know how much your domain is worth, you'll be looking to perform a process called domain valuation. This can also be referred to as domain name appraisal. It is a method for estimating the price of a specific domain name and determining if it's a good domain. If you are a domain investor or just starting to build a domain portfolio, chances are you need to use a batch domain name valuation tool.\n\nWhen it comes to expired domain hunting, using bulk domain name appraisal software is crucial. It saves time and effort by allowing the user to evaluate multiple domain names, rather than manually appraising each one individually. This domain value checker can be especially useful when dealing with large lists of expired domains, where manually appraising each one can be a time-consuming and daunting task.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"4.0.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
