It''s available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.\n\nopencode is an AI coding agent. It features:\n- A responsive, native, themeable terminal UI.\n- Automatically loads the right LSPs, so the LLMs make fewer mistakes.\n- Have multiple agents working in parallel on the same project.\n- Create shareable links to any session for reference or to debug.\n- Log in with Anthropic to use your Claude Pro or Claude Max account.\n- Supports 75+ LLM providers through Models.dev, including local models.\nThis release includes a data migration that will execute on first run. It will migrate all flat files in data directory to a single sqlite database. Depending on how much data you have and speed of computer this can take some time.\nIf you have any issues with the migration the original data is not yet deleted and downgrading should work. But please open an issue so we can investigate and include sqlite in the issue title.\nCore\n- Revert to SQLite database implementation\n- Move timeout configuration from programmatic API to CLI flag (@yanhao98)\n- Update AI SDK packages and use adaptive reasoning for Claude Opus 4.6 on Vertex, Bedrock, and Anthropic\nTUI\n- Prevent crash when tool inputs are malformed during opencode run (@0xK3vin)\n- Add --dir option to run command (@BlankParticle)\nDesktop\n- Fix Rust compilation issues in desktop application (@Brendonovich)\n- Remove OPENCODE_SQLITE environment variable from desktop (@Brendonovich)\n- Terminal resize handling fixed in app\n- Use prompt_async endpoint to avoid timeout over VPN/tunnel (@eytans)\n- Remount SDK and sync tree when server URL changes (@ysm-dev)\n- Sync docs locale cookie on alias redirects (@Seungjun0906)\n- Performance optimization for showing large diffs and files in desktop (@neriousy)\nThank you to 12 community contributors:\n- @BlankParticle:\n  - feat(cli): add --dir option to run command (#12443)\n- @neriousy:\n  - fix(desktop): performance optimization for showing large diff & files (#13460)\n- @Seungjun0906:\n  - fix(web): sync docs locale cookie on alias redirects (#13109)\n  - docs(ko): polish Korean phrasing in acp, agents, config, and custom-tools docs (#13446)\n- @ysm-dev:\n  - fix(app): remount SDK/sync tree when server URL changes (#13437)\n- @Annopick:\n  - docs: Fix zh-cn translation mistake in tools.mdx (#13407)\n- @eytans:\n  - fix(web): use prompt_async endpoint to avoid timeout over VPN/tunnel (#12749)\n- @G36maid:\n  - docs: add pacman installation option for Arch Linux alongside AUR (#13293)\n- @yanhao98:\n  - fix(test): move timeout config to CLI flag (#13494)\n- @niushuai1991:\n  - fix: standardize zh-CN docs character set and terminology (#13500)\n- @kitlangton:\n  - fix(ui): support cmd-click links in inline code (#12552)\n- @0xK3vin:\n  - fix: prevent opencode run crash on malformed tool inputs (#13051)\n- @Brendonovich:\n  - desktop: remote OPENCODE_SQLITE env (#13545)\n  - desktop: fix rust","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.2.0","version":0,"site":"https://sst.dev/","source":"opencode","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
