No programming is required to create a game, though there is a scripting language for customising the engine which has been used to create many non-RPG games.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"2021.09.13","site":"https://hamsterrepublic.com/","source":"Hamster Republic Productions","license_or_tos":"GPLv2","resources":null,"verified":false}
