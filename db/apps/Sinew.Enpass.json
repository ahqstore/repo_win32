Unlike most other popular password managers, Enpass is an offline password manager.\n\n\nThis release introduces a redesigned homepage with guided actions, clearer browser extension prompts, safer Master Password habits, and improved desktop consistency. It also adds enhanced passkey security support, including Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) support. Along with important stability fixes and broader passkey compatibility improvements across websites and browsers.\nImprovements\n- Master Password reminder experience: You’ll now be reminded to re-enter your Master Password from time to time, if you unlock Enpass using  biometrics. This helps ensure you never lose access to your encrypted data.\n- New homepage experience: Start every session with a redesigned homepage that brings clarity and direction to your Enpass experience. You can quickly understand what to do next, monitor your vault’s security health, and discover relevant premium features in one place.\n- Clear prompts to install the browser extension: You’ll now see distinct in-app notifications to help you install the Enpass browser extension, making autofill and password saving more secure and seamless across websites.\n- Enhanced passkey security (PRF support): Enpass now supports advanced security enhancements  including Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) support as part of passkey creation and sign-in. This improves compatibility, reliability, and alignment with modern WebAuthn standards while keeping existing passkeys fully compatible.\nBug fixes\n- Vault selection during item creation:\n  - New items are now saved to the vault you explicitly select during creation, preventing confusion and ensuring items are stored exactly where expected.\n- Improved startup stability:\n  -  Fixed a rare crash during startup caused by network instability.\n- Passkey creation and sign-in fixes:\n  - Resolved passkey issues on several supported websites, including Discord, Binance, Google services, Linear, Lululemon, SwissID, and others.\n  - Fixed cases where passkey options did not appear, sign-in failed to trigger, or the extension was not invoked correctly.\nSupport & feedback\nNeed help or have feedback?\nVisit our support page [https://support.enpass.io/home.htm ]","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"6.11.19.2205","version":0,"site":"https://www.enpass.io/","source":"Enpass Technologies Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
