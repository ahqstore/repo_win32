Unlike most other popular password managers, Enpass is an offline password manager.\n\n\nNew Feature for Business Users:\n- Event Logs (Enterprise Plan only): You can now view detailed logs of key events and changes made in the Enpass app and the Admin Console. These logs help track what’s happening across your organization and are available under the \"Event Logs\" section in the Admin Console.\n- SIEM Integration (Enterprise Plan only): Now, you can also connect Enpass with your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools such as Sumo Logic, Splunk, Azure Sentinel, and QRadar, for visibility, monitoring, and analysis of security events across your organization.\nEnhancements for Business Users\n- Vault restoration without password prompt: If your organization uses Enpass Hub, you can now restore or add an existing owned or shared vault without being asked for the vault password again.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"6.11.10.1953","site":"https://www.enpass.io/","source":"Enpass Technologies Inc.","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
