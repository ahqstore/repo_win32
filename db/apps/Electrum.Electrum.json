It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart.\nThere is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"version":"4.6.2","site":"https://electrum.org/","source":"Electrum Technologies GmbH","license_or_tos":"MIT License","resources":null,"verified":false}
