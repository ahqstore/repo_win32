The fix? Simply commenting out the not working function call. And it works! Hopefully, this will not make SkEditor go boom boom...Also, one more thing: some of the menu icons have been updated.That’s all for now! I just wanted to release this update as quickly as possible.🎉 Enjoy!\n\n📄 File Descriptions\n| File | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 💻 SkEditorInstaller.msi | Quick, easy installation for Windows x64 (most common) |\n| 📦 Windows-x64.zip | Portable Windows version for x64 chips (likely your version) |\n| 📦 Windows-arm64.zip | Portable Windows for ARM64 (only for ARM devices) |\n| 🐧 Linux-x64.zip | Portable Linux x64 version |\n| 🍎 macOS-x64.zip | For macOS on x64 (Intel chips) |\n| 🍏 macOS-arm64.zip | For macOS on ARM64 |\n📝 Note: macOS installation requires extra steps.
