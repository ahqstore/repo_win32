You can easily use this image downloader application on your desktop or laptop computer.\n\nVovsoft Picture Downloader is a software to find and download image files from the web. You can easily use this image downloader application on your desktop or laptop computer.\n\nThis program features a simple interface comprising two separate tabs. One tab for searching millions of image files using a search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex), and the other tab for performing a search on a specific website. The first download method allows you to select the engine and perform an online search using a keyword as the main filter, while the second requires you to enter a starting URL and look for graphics on a particular webpage recursively or not. \"Recursive URL Scan\" digs deeper and crawls all found URLs.\n\nYou can customize the download location, set the connection and the response timeouts, and use any browser agent string. No matter the method you choose, the download settings are the same. Moreover, by setting filters, you ensure this picture crawler application doesn't parse entire webpages when not needed and consequently decrease the search duration. Vovsoft Picture Downloader can look for specific image extensions and ignore user-defined URL extensions or strings. JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, SVG, WEBP and more filetypes are supported.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.1.0.0","version":0,"site":"https://vovsoft.com/","source":"VOVSOFT","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
