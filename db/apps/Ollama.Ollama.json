This will enable additional GPUs from AMD, and Intel which are not currently supported by Ollama. To build locally, install the Vulkan SDK and set VULKAN_SDK in your environment, then follow the developer instructions. In a future release, Vulkan support will be included in the binary release as well. Please file issues if you run into any problems.\nNew Contributors\n- @yajianggroup made their first contribution in https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/12377\n- @inforithmics made their first contribution in https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/11835\n- @sbhavani made their first contribution in https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/12619\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/compare/v0.12.5...v0.12.6","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"0.12.6","version":0,"site":"https://ollama.com/","source":"Ollama","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
