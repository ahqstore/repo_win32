An Epic Games Launcher open source alternative\n\nRare is a graphical interface for Legendary, a command line alternative to Epic Games launcher, based on PyQt5\n## What's Changed\n\n### New Features\n\n- Add the ability to set Tags for games. There are four predefined tags favorite, backlog, completed\n  and hidden. You can also add your own custom ones. These tags can be searched for in the search\n  bar by prefixing the tag with ::, for example ::completed. The favorites and hidden tags are also\n  available as filters.\n- Updated the main tab bar to include an Integration tab, removed the drop down menu from the\n  library's header and re-ordered the tabs. The account button is is replaced with a tab widget that\n  shows the drop down menu on click.\n- Added a selection setting for the prefix to use when using Proton. The Shared option uses a common\n  prefix and the Isolated option uses a game specific one. Or you can set a Custom one.\n- Added Steam AppID selector, useful to facilitate fixes when using custom Protons with protonfixes.\n- Added option to use per-game shader cache directories when using Wine/Proton.\n- Added configuration widget for DXVK_CONFIG env variable.\n- Added configuration widget for DXVK_NVAPI_DRS_SETTINGS.\n- Added automated workarounds/settings for some games.\n- Enabled the launcher's console window by default on Linux and updated the Terminate and Kill\n  buttons to work properly.\n- Updated how the Move dialog, and move in general works to create a sub-directory to move files\n  into.\n- Improved input validation routines in a lot of cases.\n- Support downloading games with signed chunks and reading downloaded file segments from disk to\n  reduce memory requirements.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Resolve cover image updates in parallel, improves loading responsiveness.\n- Improved performance when filtering and ordering the library views.\n- Split settings to game (universal) and compatibility (non-Windows) settings.\n- Wrappers can now be disabled without being removed from the wrapper chain.\n- Grouped Wine and Proton compatibility tool configuration.\n- Added queue worker to visualize syncing saves to the cloud on the main interface.\n- Exclude Android games from the library views by default, add specialized filter for them.\n- Add a field in the dxvk/mangohud settings to display the effective value of their environemnt\n  variable.\n- Added a static image for Epic Online Services Overlay icon.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed save path resolution to account for changed wine prefix in the settings.\n- Fixed library filters and ordering resetting after search/install/uninstall.\n- Do some sanitization of the execution environment before launching games on Linux.\n- Fix crash when Steam's 'config/libraryfolders.vdf' does not exist.\n- Do not mark application as installed if 'Donwload only' is set.\n- Fix a DivisionByZero issue when downloading image covers.\n- Filter out compatibility tools older than Proton 7.0.\n- Fix a crash when trying to terminate an already terminated process.\n\n### Packaging\n\n- From this version Rare will be using it's own Legendary fork. This was necessary to include newer\n  features and improvements not yet in a released version of the upstream project. As an unintented\n  side-effect, packaging Rare for distributions will be more complicated.\n- Rebuild resources, translations and ui files in the packaging workflows\n- Add update information to the AppImage package for automatic updates\n- Build MacOS packages on macos-15 and macos-15-intel runners","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"1.12.0","version":0,"site":"https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare","source":"UNKNOWN","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
