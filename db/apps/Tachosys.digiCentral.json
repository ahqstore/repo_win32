The software resides on a company’s own PC or Server and is licensed by use of a USB dongle. The server supports the digipostpro, digiDL, digiDL-E and digiDL-H to provide a central data repository for a local network.\nThe server provides support for remote tachograph download and detailed download scheduling. There is no support for additional features such as real-time information from the digiDL devices, GPS Tracking or in the case of digipostpro, time and attendance logging. For these higher level services you need to use the cloud version of digicentral available through your Tachosys reseller.\nThe licence is controlled via a USB software dongle which will provide a defined number of tokens.\nProduct token values:\n1. digiDL, digiDL-E & digiDL-H = 1 token\n2. digipostpro = 5 tokens\nThere are two versions of the licence available; a 50 token version and a 100 token version.\nThe software automatically calculates and displays the current token usage.\nPlease contact your Tachosys reseller for pricing.\n","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.20","version":0,"site":"https://www.tachosys.com/","source":"Tachosys","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
