Now one-time popup shown to give user a choice for future action\n🐞 Fixed issue opening some file types when Windows file associations break\n!! Archive extraction has been removed. 7zip library has several vulnerabilities so we'll wait for an update from the library developer.\nPlease use an external archiver for now (be aware that if that external archiver is based on 7zip it might have the same vulnerabilities).\nNote that Bandizip used to cause OC crashing; not tested recently but you may want to consider a different one.\nBuilt-in compressing to archive is still supported.","repo":{"author":"microsoft","repo":"winget-pkgs"},"usrVersion":"3.103.0","version":0,"site":"https://onecommander.com/","source":"Milos Paripovic","license_or_tos":"Proprietary","resources":null,"verified":false}
